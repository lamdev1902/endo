					<p>This 3-day full body workout is an efficient way to build strength and hypertrophy. It hits the major muscle groups with high-volume training, getting results without spending excessive time at the gym. Over three days you will work the upper and lower body, plus the core.</p><p>There are various fitness and health benefits to be gained from this full-body resistance training program. In addition to increasing muscle and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6279907/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bone strength</a>, resistance training builds muscle mass, aiding in weight management. It has also been found to decrease the risk of some chronic diseases and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277132/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reduce the risk of falls</a> and injuries.</p><p>For other 3-day workouts, try this <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/workouts/3-day-workout-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3-day workout split</a>.</p><div class="wp-block-group ft-snippet"><p class="has-medium-font-size">Full Body Workout For 3 Days</p><p>Try this 3-day full-body workout to gain muscle mass and strength. Hit the body’s major muscle groups with high-volume training to get results without a huge time commitment. Follow this programming example:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-1">Day 1: Full-body Workout 1.</a></li><li>Day 2: Rest.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-2">Day 3: Full-body Workout 2.</a></li><li>Day 4: Rest</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-3">Day 5: Full-body Workout 3.</a></li><li>Day 6: Rest.</li><li>Day 7: Rest.</li></ul></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Ultimate 3-Day Full Body Workout</h2><p>Program this 3-day full body workout into your week with at least one recovery day between resistance training workouts. This gives the targeted muscles the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6719818/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recommended 48–72 hours of rest</a> between sessions. Recovery days can be non-exercise days or involve activities like low-intensity cardio or yoga.</p><p>If you’re asking, “<a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/how-many-sets-and-reps-should-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How many sets and reps should I do</a>?” we’re going to address those guidelines below.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-1">Day 1</h3><p>The upper-body muscles worked in this session include the biceps, triceps, chest, and upper back. The rectus abdominis, obliques, and erector spinae are targeted during the plank. Lower-body exercises, like squats and lunges, strengthen the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves.</p><p>In a lunge, the muscle activation rate for <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8136561/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the rectus femoris</a> (one of four parts of the quadriceps) is about 65%. In the up (concentric) phase of a squat, the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2813-0413/2/1/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">muscle activation rates</a> are as follows:</p><ul><li>Rectus femoris — approximately 55%.</li><li>Bicep femoris (hamstrings) — approximately 60%.</li></ul><p>These statistics demonstrate how hard the muscles are working in these lower-body exercises.</p><p>Building lower-body muscles improves functional strength for daily tasks, like <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10987311/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">getting in and out of a chair</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jpts/28/12/28_jpts-2016-777/_article/-char/ja/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">quadriceps strength</a> is associated with dynamic (moving) and static (still) balance. Both <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/3/1074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">functional training</a> and improving balance can lower the risk of falls and injuries, especially in older adults.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-2">Day 2</h3><p>Day two mainly focuses on the upper body, working the pectoralis, deltoids, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, biceps, and triceps. It also includes the leg curl and leg extension machines to isolate the quadriceps and hamstrings. By working opposing muscle groups on each side of the body, this program provides a well-balanced strengthening workout.</p><p>As we age, our bone density naturally decreases, which can lead to a condition in which the bones are weakened called <a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">osteoporosis</a>. Resistance training can help <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6279907/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">maintain or increase bone mass</a>, reducing the risk of this condition. Studies on aging men with low bone density showed that resistance training <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590109523000800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">slowed osteoporosis progression</a> and improved balance and mobility.</p><p>Middle-aged women are at increased risk of osteoporosis due to bone loss during menopause. Research has found that resistance training <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5067416/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">improved leg</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/5/1904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lower-back bone density</a> in women. Increasing muscle and bone strength can reduce the risk of falls and injuries.</p><figure class="wp-block-table table-custom h-title table-border" style="font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-weight:500">Day 2</figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-3">Day 3</h3><p>The third workout employs leg presses and deadlifts to hit the hamstrings, glutes, quadriceps, and calves. The upper body movements engage the latissimus dorsi, pectoralis, biceps, triceps, deltoids, and trapezius.</p><p>Planks are a full-body exercise activating the rectus abdominis, obliques, and erector spinae in the core.

This program benefits those looking to bulk up but are short on time.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reduces Age-Related Disease Risk </h3><p>Resistance training can positively impact our health and reduce the risk of developing certain <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00645/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">age-related chronic diseases</a>. One study showed that resistance training can lower the chances of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35599175/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Another study</a> found it reduced the likelihood of disease-related mortality.</p><p>Just one resistance training session a week is associated with a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7385554/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">decreased risk of cardiovascular disease</a>. Resistance training can <a href="https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-021-00321-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">improve blood sugar levels</a>, blood fat profiles, and body fat percentage. These are all risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Aids In Fat Loss</h3><p>Resistance training can help with weight management and fat tissue reduction. Basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy the body burns at rest. The quantity of muscle mass in the body directly impacts this rate.</p><p>The more muscle mass you have, the more energy your body burns at work and rest.&nbsp;</p><p>One study found that nine months of resistance training resulted in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25293431/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">5% increase in the body’s resting metabolism</a>. This means the body burns 5% more calories in a resting state after completing the resistance training program. </p><p>Full-body workouts, like this 3-day program, have proven <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsc.12104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">better at decreasing whole-body fat</a> compared to split routines. In addition, high-volume training can <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-016-9901-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">improve fat metabolism</a> — the body’s ability to burn fat for energy. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-016-9901-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">High-volume resistance training</a> can reduce abdominal fat more effectively than low-volume training.</p><p>Research on weight loss shows that exercise training can reduce visceral fat, the fat around the internal organs. This type of fat is linked with a higher <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/8350527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">risk of serious health conditions</a> like coronary artery disease.  Exercise training is <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/obr.12406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">superior at decreasing visceral fat</a> compared to fat loss from dieting.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Training Tips To Keep In Mind </h2><ul><li>When you are ready to progress the load in this program, try increasing each exercise’s weight by five lbs. If you can’t complete 10 reps per set with a five lbs increase, try a 2–3 lbs increase. Depending on your starting weight, five lbs may be a big jump for smaller muscle groups like the biceps, triceps, or deltoids.</li><li>Actively focus on contracting the target muscles working during the exercise. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6615069/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mind-muscle connection</a> can increase muscle activation, helping you get more out of your workout.</li><li>Sufficient high-quality protein consumption is important to muscle growth. Recommendations from the International Society of Sports Nutrition state that exercisers should <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/S12970-017-0177-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">intake protein every 3–4 hours</a> throughout the day. They advise a daily intake of 1.4–2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.</li><li>Active recovery is low-intensity physical activity done during the post-workout recovery period. Studies show <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5932411/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">active recovery</a> can reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness from exercising. On rest days, consider walking or biking to reduce muscle soreness.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><p>This 3-day full body workout can help improve body composition by increasing muscle mass and decreasing fat mass. It can also help reduce the risk of serious health conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Best of all, this program offers high-volume training in just 3 workouts a week. If you’re wondering <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/how-many-exercises-per-muscle-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how many exercises per muscle group</a> are part of this routine, the answer is 2–3.</p><p>You can gain muscular strength and hypertrophy while still having adequate recovery time, preventing harmful overtraining effects.</p><div class="wp-block-group"><h2 class="wp-block-heading faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1623393125914"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Are 3-day full-body workouts effective?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">3-day full-body workouts are effective because <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6303131/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">training volume</a> is more important than training frequency.

					<p>Rounded, separated deltoids add width to your upper body. When your shoulders are wide and capped, you’ll accentuate that classic V structure. By targeting the front deltoids, you’ll add mass above the chest. This gives the upper body a rugged, powerful appearance.</p><p>This article describes the ten best front delt exercises, from the dumbbell front raise to the barbell military press. We’ve included video demonstrations, step-by-step instructions, and expert tips for each exercise. You’ll also find set and rep guidance as well as a sample front deltoid workout.</p><p>Read on for your complete guide to optimized front deltoid training.</p><div class="wp-block-group box-grey"><p class="has-medium-font-size">Front Shoulder Workouts For Upper Body Development</p><p>The ten best front delt exercises are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Dumbbell-Front-Raise">Dumbbell front raise</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Barbell-Front-Raise">Barbell front raise</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Weight-Plate-Front-Raise">Weight plate front raise</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Cable%20Shoulder%20Internal%20Rotation">Cable shoulder internal rotation</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Dumbbell%20Seated%20Shoulder%20Press">Dumbbell seated shoulder press</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Alternating-Dumbbell-Press">Alternating dumbbell press</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Cable%20Lateral%20Raise">Cable lateral raise</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Behind%20The%20Neck%20Press">Behind the neck press</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Dumbbell-Arnold-Press">Dumbbell Arnold press</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Barbell-Military-Press">Barbell military press</a>.</li></ul></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">Best Front Delt Exercises</h2><p>Here are the ten best exercises to isolate and target the front deltoid. We’ve included exercises done with dumbbells, a barbell, a weight plate, and cables to cover every training situation.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Dumbbell-Front-Raise">Dumbbell Front Raise</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/dumbbell-front-raise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumbbell front raise</a> isolates the anterior, or front, deltoids. This exercise moves the front delts through their full range of motion. The secondary muscles that work are the clavicular head of the pectorals (chest), the serratus anterior, and the biceps brachii.</p><p>By using dumbbells, you can work each side of the front delts individually. This form of unilateral training prevents the stronger side from taking over, preventing uneven development. The dumbbell front raise is an isolation movement that requires slow, deliberate movement. During the movement's lowering (eccentric) phase, you must resist gravity to keep tension on the working muscle.</p><p>The dumbbell front raise <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/best-shoulder-workout-for-mass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">builds muscle mass</a> and strength in the front part of the shoulder muscle. It also increases shoulder joint stability. This helps to improve sports performance when throwing and swinging a bat. Increasing shoulder stability also helps to reduce the risk of shoulder injury.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo vimeo-custom wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://vimeo.com/970294847?share=copy</div>Dumbbell Front Raise Guide.

The upper chest, serratus, latissimus dorsi, core, and biceps brachii support the movement. This exercise helps build strength and muscle mass in the anterior deltoid. It will also improve shoulder stability.</p><p>Strong front deltoids are essential for all pressing movements. So, performing the barbell front raise helps improve your strength on such exercises as the bench press and overhead press. It will also improve your functional strength for sports and everyday life when pushing against an opponent or lifting objects.</p><p>Using a barbell instead of a dumbbell requires a different form of stability through the core and serratus.

Its muscle fibers originate on the outer part of the clavicle bone.&nbsp;They insert on the top of the humerus (upper arm bone).&nbsp;</p><p>The primary function of the front delt is to lift the arm forward and upward toward the clavicle. As a result, it is directly involved in front raise and pressing exercises. It is also activated when doing chest pressing exercises.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">Benefits Of Front Delt Exercises</h2><p>Front delt exercises are crucial for developing total shoulder muscle mass and strength. Here are three specific benefits of including front delt exercises in your routine.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Targeted Muscle Growth</h3><p>Front delt exercises allow you to isolate the anterior deltoid muscle head. This places localized stress on this area of the shoulders. With proper rest and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18384284/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">anabolic nutrition</a>, they will grow slightly bigger to meet future stress.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Functional Strength</h3><p>Strong front delts are needed for everyday pushing and lifting activities. They also contribute significantly to pressing exercises like the bench and dumbbell press. By incorporating front delt exercises, you will become functionally stronger and improve your <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33555823/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bench pressing power</a>.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Balanced Development</h3><p>When you perform targeted exercises for each of the three deltoid heads, you promote even development. <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/shoulder-workouts-for-men" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shoulder workouts for men</a> and women that include front delt movements prevent muscle imbalances that could lead to injury.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common Mistakes To Avoid&nbsp;</h2><p>The most common mistake when training the front delts is using a weight that is too heavy. The front delt is a relatively small part of the shoulder muscle. If the weight is too heavy to handle, other muscles will become involved. This will take the stress off the targeted muscle and compromise its strength and growth potential.</p><p>Another common mistake is not controlling the exercise's lowering (eccentric) part. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37293426/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Studies</a> show that a slow, controlled descent significantly improves muscle and strength potential.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-end">Conclusion</h2><p>You will develop powerful, rounded front shoulder muscles by including front delt exercises in your workout.

					<p>An upper lower split is a popular program for fitness enthusiasts who want a well-rounded routine for maximum results. It targets each major muscle group twice per week by separating them into upper and lower body splits. It also programs rest days throughout the week to prioritize recovery.</p><p>The split uses <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5744434/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">compound movements</a> to work multiple muscles simultaneously. Upper days focus on chest, arms, and back while lower days work your glutes, quads, and hamstrings. This supports most strength goals and can be modified based on experience level.</p><p>When programming this workout, it is important to understand <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/how-many-sets-per-muscle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how many sets per muscle</a> to perform for the desired results.

These muscles are highly influential in daily tasks involving lifting, pushing, and carrying. Squeeze the target muscles slowly and use control during each movement to get maximal engagement.</p><p>Perform 2–3 sets of these compound exercises with an isolation-style movement using 3-second negatives at the end of indicated sets. A negative refers to the extension, or lowering, phase of the lift, applying tension while the muscle lengthens. This promotes upper body balanced development by targeting each muscle group in different ways. </p><p>A study on muscle activation for select back exercises found that the lat pulldown significantly engages the latissimus dorsi. The muscle activation rate can reach approximately <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/21/11138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20% of maximum voluntary contraction</a>.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lower-Body-A">Lower Body A</h3><p>Day two builds and strengthens the glutes, hamstrings, calves, and quadriceps.

Additionally, the shoulders engage to provide stability throughout the movements.</p><p>These muscles are essential for supporting shoulder extension, adduction, and internal rotation. This refers to bringing your arm backward, across your body, and turning it inwards.

The full range of motion combined with the use of 3-second negatives will maximally fatigue the target muscles. This will enhance your physique as the muscles rebuild larger and stronger.</p><figure class="wp-block-table table-custom h-title table-border" style="font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-weight:500">Upper Body B</figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lower-Body-B">Lower Body B</h3><p>Day four is the final day of this routine and focuses on the lower body. It uses high volume and heavy load to maximally fatigue your body’s largest muscles. These include your glutes, quads, and hamstrings, as well as calves, core, and lower back.</p><p>These exercises will boost your metabolism by amping the intensity to reap maximum gains. They contribute to an aesthetically pleasing and balanced lower body physique and benefit functional activities like climbing, running, and jumping.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, movements like the squat <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6050697/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">strengthen the lower body muscles</a> that support proper knee alignment.

We provide details on some key ones below.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Builds Strength</h3><p>Building strength requires <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323944795_Effects_of_different_intensities_of_resistance_training_with_equated_volume_load_on_muscle_strength_and_hypertrophy#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">applying resistance</a> to a target muscle using a stimulus. This involves a combination of muscle balance, coordination, and focused movement to achieve the desired results.</p><p>As this routine engages all major muscle groups twice a week, it is very effective for building full body strength. The targeted muscles are also used in daily activities like carrying groceries, climbing stairs, or bending to lift heavy boxes. Therefore, following this routine will improve muscle strength and functional performance for an <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5450110/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enhanced quality of life</a>.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enhances Physique</h3><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Enhances-Physique-endomondo.jpg" alt="Enhances Physique" class="wp-image-35417"/>The upper/lower workout split leads to a more well-rounded figure. <span>Photo: prostooleh/Freepik</span></figure><p>The muscles worked throughout this routine are key for contributing to an aesthetically pleasing physique. Developing them will add definition and sculpt to tour entire body, leading to improved muscle symmetry and balance. </p><p>All movements use a compound approach to engage multiple muscles throughout the movement. In addition, performing the negative movement will <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29372481/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">isolate the target muscles</a> and work them differently for more balanced development. This leads to a more well-rounded figure, making these exercises beneficial for toning your entire body.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Training Structure</h3><p>For fitness enthusiasts who like structure and advanced planning in their training, the upper/lower workout is a valuable option. There are different ways to program your split, but the formula is similar with exercises prescribed based on muscle group. This leaves little room for alterations as you need to work each muscle group twice per week with adequate recovery.</p><p>This is beneficial as it helps you organize and structure your plan to achieve maximum results. It also ensures you are incorporating rest days to allow your muscles to repair from the hard sessions.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Maximize An Upper/Lower Split </h2><p>Below are some recommended training tips to keep in mind:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Start with a lower overall volume until you become accustomed to the workload. Increase gradually from there to avoid injury or strain.</li><li>Concentrate on squeezing each muscle to enhance the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26700744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mind-muscle connection</a>. This is especially important in the negative phase of the exercises.</li><li>When determining when to add weight to your training load, an optimal method is the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34101157/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>2 for 2 rule</strong></a>. When you can complete 2 additional reps than your target range 2 weeks in a row, you can add weight. Start with small increases (1–2 lbs for upper and 3–4 lbs for lower) to avoid injury and compromising form.</li><li>In addition to the scheduled weekly rest days, you should schedule a cut-back week once you complete the 10-week program. This is essential to prioritize muscle recovery before starting a new routine or ramping up the intensity.</li><li>Aim to schedule ab work at the end of a lifting session or on rest days. Light yoga and stretching are great options on rest days to promote blood flow to the muscles and enhance recovery.</li><li>Make sure to use slow and controlled movements and don’t rely on momentum to complete the exercises. This helps ensure proper form is maintained to reduce injury potential.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><p>The upper/lower workout split provides significant rewards for all gymgoers. It can be customized for beginners up to advanced lifters, depending on goals and experience. It provides a well-rounded routine working each major muscle group twice per week with rest days throughout to maximize recovery.</p><p>While there are a variety of programs you can follow for an effective lifting routine, this one provides valuable benefits. We are confident you will achieve the desired results if you follow our guidance when building your training plan.&nbsp;</p><div class="wp-block-group"><h2 class="wp-block-heading faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1623393125914"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Is upper-lower an effective split?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The upper/lower is an effective split for beginners and advanced gymgoers who want a structured plan that builds muscle and strength.

By focusing on different muscle groups each day, you can maximize your efforts and see consistent progress.</p><p>This plan can be followed for 6-12 weeks, depending on your goals. If your aim is to build muscle, aim for 8-12 weeks of consistent training. For general fitness or strength maintenance, 6-8 weeks is ideal before adjusting your routine to prevent plateaus.</p><p><strong>Sample Weekly Schedule:</strong></p><ul><li>Monday: Day 1 - Lower body and back.</li><li>Wednesday: Day 2 - Upper body and shoulders.</li><li>Friday: Day 3 - Full-body strength and arms.</li><li>Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday: Rest or active recovery (Light cardio, stretching, or yoga).</li></ul><p>This split targets all major muscle groups, provides adequate recovery, and is both efficient and adaptable for various fitness levels.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-1">Day 1</h3><p>Day 1 focuses on developing strength in key muscle groups, including the legs, back, chest, shoulders, and arms. This builds a strong foundation for overall fitness. Compound movements, such as dumbbell squats, bent-over rows, and the bench press, are <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7745915/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multi-joint exercises</a>. They engage multiple muscles and joints simultaneously, improving strength, coordination, and efficiency.</p><p>For example, the dumbbell squat works the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and lower back while improving core stability. Similarly, the bench press targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps, making it an excellent <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/dumbbell-chest-workout-without-bench" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumbbell chest workout with a bench</a>. Isolation exercises, like curls and lateral raises, fine-tune smaller muscles for symmetry and detail.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-2">Day 2</h3><p>Day 2 emphasizes building strength and endurance in the lower body while enhancing shoulder stability and upper-body definition. This workout features compound and isolation movements to target the legs, glutes, hamstrings, shoulders, and arms. Exercises like lunges and deadlifts develop functional lower-body strength, improve balance, and boost power in a well-rounded <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/dumbbell-leg-workout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumbbell leg workout</a>.</p><p>The dumbbell deadlift <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7046193/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">engages multiple muscles</a>, including the erector spinae, quadriceps, and hamstrings. Strengthening the posterior chain improves posture, enhances athletic performance, and supports everyday movements like lifting and bending. Adding the dumbbell Arnold press uniquely <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322132613_Comparison_among_the_EMG_Activity_of_the_Anterior_Deltoid_and_Medial_Deltoid_During_Two_Variations_of_Dumbbell_Shoulder_Press_Exercise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">activates the anterior and medial deltoids</a> more effectively than a standard shoulder press.</p><p>Isolation moves, like the dumbbell chest fly, fine-tune smaller muscles for symmetry and detail.

This workout is designed to target the legs, glutes, arms, shoulders, and back while improving stability and control.</p><p>It begins with movements designed to build functional strength. Maximum voluntary isometric contraction, or MVIC, is a measure of how much a muscle activates during an exercise. For example, step-ups achieve gluteus maximus activation levels as <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039033/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">high as 125% MVIC</a>.

By targeting different muscle groups across three days, this split maximizes results while allowing adequate recovery. Let’s explore its key benefits.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Efficient Use Of Time</h3><p>A 3-day dumbbell workout split is ideal for those with busy schedules. It allows you to train effectively while leaving four days a week for rest, hobbies, or other responsibilities. This balance ensures that fitness doesn’t overwhelm your life, making it easier to stay consistent.</p><p>Despite only training three days, this split targets all major muscle groups, ensuring comprehensive results. Compound exercises, such as squats and deadlifts, engage multiple muscles in one movement, maximizing the effectiveness of each session.&nbsp;</p><p>Spreading training across multiple days has been shown to have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102172/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">superior hypertrophy</a> compared to lower-frequency routines. This means you can see impressive results without dedicating every day to the gym. By focusing on quality rather than quantity, this approach ensures you can gain strength, build muscle, and improve overall fitness.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Balanced Muscle Development</h3><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Balanced-Muscle-Development-endomondo.jpg" alt="Balanced Muscle Development " class="wp-image-35387"/>A 3-day dumbbell workout split helps improve your physique in a well-rounded, proportional way. <span>Photo: prostooleh/Freepik</span></figure><p>Targeted training across specific days ensures no muscle group is left behind. For example, one day focuses on the lower body and core, while another hones in on the upper body and arms. This structure allows muscles to recover fully while avoiding overtraining.</p><p>Alternating between compound movements and isolation exercises promotes strength and symmetry. Compound exercises, like squats and rows, engage multiple muscles simultaneously, improving coordination and building functional fitness. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8450457/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Functional training</a> enhances your ability to perform everyday activities, such as lifting, carrying, and climbing. </p><p>Incorporating a variety of exercises, including <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/one-dumbbell-workout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one dumbbell workout</a>, refines and shapes muscles while supporting overall balance. Balanced training <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9982145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">supports better posture</a>, reduces the risk of injury, and enhances overall aesthetics. It also helps correct imbalances that can develop from unstructured routines or daily habits. With this approach, your physique improves in a well-rounded, proportional way.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recovery And Growth</h3><p>Recovery is a key component of any effective fitness routine, and this split ensures muscles get the rest they need. By working different muscle groups on separate days, your body has time to repair and rebuild stronger. This balance prevents overtraining, which can lead to fatigue, injury, or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37787845/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plateaus</a>.</p><p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5932411/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Adequate recovery</a> allows for greater gains in strength and muscle size. During rest, muscles repair micro tears caused by training, leading to growth and improved performance. Active recovery, such as light stretching or walking on rest days, keeps the body moving without adding strain.</p><p>With four rest or low-impact days, this plan fits perfectly into a busy lifestyle. It promotes consistent, sustainable progress without burnout. Whether your goal is building muscle or improving fitness, prioritizing recovery ensures you stay energized and ready for every workout. Recovery isn’t downtime, it’s when growth happens.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Maximize This Workout Split</h2><ul><li><strong>Warm-Up —</strong> Begin every session with a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350401898_Warming-Up_for_Resistance_Training_and_Muscular_Performance_A_Narrative_Review#:~:text=Warming%2Dup%20is%20an%20indispensable,the%20effects%20on%20force%20production." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proper warm-up</a>. Focus on light cardio, mobility exercises, and movements that mimic your workout. This prepares your muscles, improves flexibility, and reduces injury risk.</li><li><strong>Tempo Control —</strong> Focus on controlling the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8919893/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eccentric phase</a> of each movement, which is the lowering or lengthening portion of the exercise. Slow, controlled movements engage muscles more effectively than rushing through reps.</li><li><strong>Progressive Overload —</strong> <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528903/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Progressive overload</a> ensures your muscles are consistently challenged. This means gradually increasing the intensity of your workouts over time. Add more weight to your dumbbells and increase the number of reps or sets. These adjustments force your muscles to adapt, leading to greater strength and growth.</li><li><strong>Consistency Is Key —</strong> Stick to your schedule. Training three days a week allows for adequate recovery while building strength and endurance. Stay committed to each session for long-term success.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><p>A 3-day dumbbell workout split is an efficient and effective way to build strength, balance, and definition without overwhelming your schedule. By targeting different muscle groups on specific days, you ensure recovery, balanced development, and steady progress. With compound exercises for functional strength and isolation moves for fine-tuning, this split covers all aspects of fitness.</p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31267674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Consistency</a>, proper form, and techniques like tempo control and progressive overload help you maximize results.

					<p>Are you looking for a balanced workout plan that’s easy to follow? The push pull legs routine is a popular choice among fitness enthusiasts. It divides workouts into three days, targeting different muscle groups to ensure comprehensive training and optimal recovery.</p><p>The PPL workout utilizes compound and isolation exercises, making them ideal for building strength and improving endurance. Suitable for beginners and experienced lifters alike, this split can be customized to fit any fitness level or goal.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, this approach provides a flexible yet structured plan to accommodate a busy lifestyle. It allows you to choose training days, rest days, and optional active recovery sessions to suit your schedule. Let’s dive into the structure, exercises, and benefits of this transformative workout plan.</p><div class="wp-block-group ft-snippet"><p class="has-medium-font-size">3-Day PPL Workout Plan</p><p>The push-pull legs routine trains all major muscle groups while also incorporating optimal recovery time.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-1:-Push"><strong>Day 1: Push</strong></a> – Focuses on the chest, shoulders, and triceps for greater strength and definition.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-2:-Pull">Day 2: Pull</a></strong> – Targets the back, biceps, and traps to improve pulling strength and posture.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-3:-Legs">Day 3: Legs and Abs</a></strong> – Develops lower-body strength, stability, and core endurance.</li></ul></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading">3-Day Push Pull Legs Routine</h2><p>Each day of the <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/workouts/3-day-workout-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3-day workout split</a> targets specific areas of the body while ensuring other muscle groups sufficiently recover. This approach promotes balanced development, minimizes fatigue, and keeps you progressing steadily.</p><p>A typical weekly schedule involves alternating training and rest days, making it suitable for most fitness levels. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Monday:</strong> Push.</li><li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Rest.</li><li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Pull.</li><li><strong>Thursday:</strong> Rest.</li><li><strong>Friday:</strong> Legs.</li><li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Rest.</li><li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Optional active recovery.</li></ul><p>By targeting complementary muscle groups on each day, the PPL split ensures that exercises build upon one another. Over time, this allows for consistent progression, improved endurance, and reduced risk of injury. Below, we outline the exercises and goals for each day.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-1:-Push">Day 1: Push</h3><p>The push workout targets your chest, shoulders, and triceps, emphasizing pressing and extension movements.&nbsp;</p><p>Start with the barbell military press, which primarily works the shoulders and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30725681/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">triceps</a>. It builds overhead pressing strength and stability. The dumbbell bench press follows. It activates the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30855905/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chest</a>, shoulders, and triceps with a greater range of motion compared to the barbell version. </p><p>Next, dumbbell lateral raises isolate the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6251069/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deltoids</a> (the shoulder muscles). This movement improves shoulder aesthetics and strength.

By dividing workouts into related muscle groups and movements, the routine minimizes overtraining and maximizes results.</p><p>A balanced approach to training reduces the risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36035582/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">muscular imbalances</a>, which can lead to injury. Furthermore, the likelihood of long-term consistency with training is increased because of the variety. The same muscles are not worked on back-to-back days and different focuses can help prevent burnout and waning motivation.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Efficient Training</h3><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Efficient-Training-endomondo.jpg" alt="Efficient Training" class="wp-image-35371"/>The PPL workout maximizes gains without the need for overly long rest periods or training every day. <span>Photo: ibrakovic/Freepik</span></figure><p>The structure of the PPL workout allows muscle groups to recover while others are being trained. This reduces fatigue and allows the body to perform at full strength during each session.&nbsp;</p><p>Recovery periods between sessions promote better muscle repair, reducing soreness and overtraining risks. Efficient recovery ensures sustained progress, as muscles rebuild stronger after each workout. This maximizes gains without the need for overly long rest periods or training every day.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Customizable For All Levels</h3><p>Whether you’re a novice or an advanced lifter, the PPL split is easily adaptable. Beginners can focus on mastering form with lighter weights, while experienced lifters can increase intensity through progressive overload. Regardless of intensity, the structure stays the same.</p><p>The flexibility of sets and reps allows you to tailor the routine to specific targets. The same split and exercises can be used, whether the goal is <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7927075/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">strength, hypertrophy, or endurance</a>. This versatility makes PPL a long-term solution for fitness progression regardless of experience. </p><p>Advanced lifters can utilize drop sets (training to failure, then reducing the weight and repeating) to further challenge their muscles. Meanwhile, beginners can modify exercises or reduce intensity, ensuring they progress safely and effectively. Its scalability makes it valuable for transitioning between different phases of training.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Apply Progressive Overload In A PPL Routine</h2><p>When planning a workout routine, common questions include "<a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/how-many-sets-per-muscle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How many sets per muscle</a>?" or “How much weight should I use?”. Unfortunately, there isn’t one universal number that is right for everyone. </p><p>The key to growth is about continuously making your muscles work hard. The sets, reps, and weight needed will depend on an individual’s fitness level and experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s say you complete an exercise lifting 10kg for three sets with eight reps per set and this is challenging. If you do this for long enough, this will become easy and your muscle growth will plateau.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, as an exercise becomes easier you need to change the parameters to maintain its difficulty. This technique is called progressive overload, and it is <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/24/4897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">crucial for consistent muscle growth and strength gains</a>.</p><p>There are many ways to apply progressive overload to a PPL routine. One of the most common is to start by adding extra weight to your lifts in small increments. Focus on maintaining proper form as you increase resistance.</p><p>You can also increase the number of reps or sets for each exercise. Consistently increasing your total volume promotes better <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27219125/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">muscular adaptation and growth</a>. </p><p>Another method is reducing rest periods between sets. Moreover, incorporating advanced variations, such as paused reps or tempo changes, is another effective way to add difficulty.</p><p>Tracking your progress is key. Use a training log to monitor weights, reps, and sets, ensuring consistent progression. By applying these techniques, you’ll prevent plateaus and maintain steady improvements.</p><p>Incorporating progressive overload requires patience and discipline. Avoid increasing intensity too quickly to reduce the risk of injury. Instead, focus on gradual, measurable improvements that align with your long-term fitness goals.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Note About Rest And Recovery </h2><p>Rest days are as vital as training days. They allow your muscles to repair and grow, ensuring you’re ready for the next workout. The time needed to recover fully varies based on factors such as physical fitness and training intensity. However, on average, muscles need <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-017-3725-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">48–72 hours</a> to repair between workouts.</p><p>Moreover, <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2022/02000/effect_of_active_recovery_protocols_on_the.5.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">active recovery strategies</a> can help optimize downtime. For example, jogging can reduce inflammatory markers and yoga can decrease muscle soreness and improve flexibility. Listening to your body is essential. Overtraining can hinder progress and increase the risk of injury. Balancing effort and recovery ensures long-term success.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><p>The push pull legs routine is a versatile workout split that promotes balanced strength, muscular development, and recovery. Its structure ensures all muscle groups are trained efficiently while providing ample time for rest.</p><p>Moreover, the adaptability of this routine ensures it remains relevant as you progress. Whether training for aesthetics, performance, or general fitness, the PPL split offers a sustainable path to success. Stay consistent, challenge yourself, and enjoy the transformation.&nbsp;</p><div class="wp-block-group"><h2 class="wp-block-heading faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1623393125914"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Is PPL 3x a week too much?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">No, the routine balances intensity and recovery well.

					<p>When it comes to choosing the best training method, deciding between calisthenics vs. Pilates can be tough. With both being popular bodyweight workout styles, distinguishing the key differences between the two isn’t always easy.</p><p>But today, all of that changes. In this article, we’re going to help you clearly understand the differences between these two workout styles.</p><p>By doing a side-by-side comparison, including their unique focuses, time and equipment commitments, and techniques used, we’ll clear your confusion. Let’s make it easy to decide what’s the right bodyweight workout style for you.</p><div class="wp-block-group ft-snippet"><p class="has-medium-font-size">Calisthenics Vs. Pilates</p><p>Calisthenics and Pilates are two bodyweight workouts designed to develop lean muscle mass and strength. However, the similarities between these two workouts end there.</p><p>Calisthenics workouts include dynamic, compound exercises performed at high rep counts. The goal of calisthenics is to improve muscular endurance and functional strength.</p><p>Pilates is a workout that was initially created to help dancers overcome repetitive motion injuries. It utilizes precise movements performed slowly to improve core strength—with a large focus on flexibility, too.</p></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">Calisthenics Vs. Pilates: Key Information</h2><p>With calisthenics and Pilates both being bodyweight exercises, you might find yourself wondering, “Is Pilates calisthenics?”&nbsp;</p><p>While they share some similar features, these two exercise styles also have key differences. Below, we’ll dive into these differences and help you decide what the better option is for reaching your unique fitness goals.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Focus</h3><p>Both calisthenics and Pilates focus on building leaner muscle mass through the use of bodyweight exercises. However, apart from these basic similarities, these two exercise styles couldn’t be more different.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/calisthenics-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calisthenics benefits</a> are mostly related to developing strength in all of the major muscle groups. It utilizes dynamic and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7745915/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multi-joint movements</a>, such as squats, planks, and pull-ups, to help users build strength. Calisthenic workouts also don’t have a major focus on improving flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison, a huge focus of Pilates workouts is improving flexibility. And while most of the major muscle groups are involved in Pilates movements, the main focus is increasing core strength. These two benefits are achieved through the performance of slow, controlled, and very precise movements.</p><p>For this reason, it’s recommended that you practice reformer <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/is-pilates-good-for-weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pilates for weight loss</a> with a teacher to learn proper technique.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Equipment</h3><p>One of the biggest draws for calisthenic workouts is that they require no equipment to get started. Many of the staple calisthenic exercises, including planks, squats, lunges, dips, and chin-ups, can be performed at home.</p><p>Individuals wanting to enhance their calisthenics workout variety can do so with very little investment. Parallette bars are a cheap and effective tool that can be used with resistance bands to tackle more advanced postures. These include V-sits and straddle planches.</p><p>Pilates also offers an equipment-free, free-flow version that can be practiced at home without equipment. However, reformer Pilates is a popular option that can be costly for equipment or in-studio classes.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time Commitment</h3><p>In the battle between calisthenics vs Pilates, the flexibility of a calisthenics workout is appealing to many people. These workouts can last anywhere from 20–60 minutes, with <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8294064/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">short, high-intensity sessions</a> or longer full-body routines being equally effective.</p><p>Free-flow Pilates and calisthenics can be practiced from home, negating the need to spend extra time commuting to class. However, Pilates can require more of a time commitment.</p><p>Pilates classes typically follow a structured routine involving warm-up and cool-down exercises. Because of this, you can expect classes to last 45–60 minutes.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technique</h3><p>Both calisthenics and Pilates aim to improve muscle strength and overall health. However, the techniques they utilize to do so couldn’t be more different.</p><p>Calisthenics emphasizes power, dynamic movement, and functional strength. It utilizes full-body exercises that engage all of the major muscle groups, with high repetitions performed to induce muscle fatigue.</p><p>Pilates, on the other hand, focuses on precision, control, and core stability, with an intentional focus on alignment and flow.&nbsp;</p><p>Movements are meant to be fluid and are designed to improve muscle strength while simultaneously challenging mobility and flexibility. Additionally, synchronized movements with deep, diaphragmatic breathing activate the deep core muscles and encourage a <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-023-01302-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mind-body connection</a>.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who Should Prioritize Calisthenics</h2><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Who-Should-Prioritize-Calisthenics-endomondo.jpg" alt="Who Should Prioritize Calisthenics" class="wp-image-35313"/>Calisthenics is an attractive option for people just starting their workout journey. <span>Photo: EyeEm/Freepik</span></figure><p><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/what-is-calisthenics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calisthenics</a> is an ideal workout option for people looking for a low-commitment exercise option.&nbsp;</p><p>Workouts are highly versatile, with full workouts performed in as little as 20 minutes. Most calisthenics exercises can also be performed at home, with little to no equipment. This makes it an attractive option for people just starting their workout journey.</p><p>Additionally, calisthenics workouts are a better option than Pilates for people who want a full-body, functional movement workout. Beginners and older gym go-ers alike can benefit from developing their strength, endurance, balance, and agility in a holistic way.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who Should Prioritize Pilates</h2><p>Compared with calisthenics, the <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/benefits-of-pilates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits of Pilates</a> are much more specific to improving flexibility, mobility, and core strength. Initially developed for dancers, it is ideal for individuals wanting to improve stability and overall body control.&nbsp;</p><p>Its low-impact nature and focus on slow, controlled movements also make Pilates a wonderful option for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29332746/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">injury rehabilitation</a> and prevention. Individuals wanting a practice that combines mindfulness and deep breathing will also be better suited to a Pilates practice.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><p>When deciding between starting a new calisthenics or Pilates fitness routine, the best choice boils down to your fitness goals.&nbsp;</p><p>For full-body strength, functional fitness, and versatility, calisthenics is a great choice. However, if core strength, flexibility, and mindful movement are your priorities, Pilates will be a better fit.</p><p>At the end of the day, it’s important to choose the exercise type that you find the most enjoyable and easiest to stick to.

While there are different ways to program your split, the general formula is similar. You work the upper and lower body twice a week. Each session is either focused on strength or on hypertrophy.&nbsp;</p><p>This is beneficial as it helps you organize and structure your plan to achieve maximum results. To progress with the PHUL workout, start with a lower volume and gradually add more as you build strength.</p><p>Using the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34101157/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>2-for-2 rule</strong></a> is a beneficial method to determine when you can add weight. Once you can complete two additional reps over your target range two weeks in a row, you can add weight. Start with small increases (1–2 lbs for upper and 3–4 lbs for lower) to avoid injury and compromising form.</p><p>Additionally, it is crucial to adhere to the scheduled rest days in between hard lifting sessions. This allows your body to recover so you can reap the benefits achieved from the active days. Focus on prioritizing nutrition, hydration, and quality sleep on your recovery days.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Training Tips To Keep In Mind </h2><p>Below are some training tips to keep in mind if you decide to pursue the PHUL workout routine:</p><ul><li>When beginning the program, start with a lower overall volume until you become accustomed to the workload. Increase gradually from there to avoid injury or strain.</li><li>Sets should be completed with at least one rep left in the tank. This means it should be challenging to complete the heavier sets but not impossible.</li><li>On hypertrophy days, you should target maximum effort to effectively fatigue the muscles. However, strength days should not be done at full intensity but with lower volume and weight to prioritize proper form.</li><li>Focus on engaging the target muscle groups on active days to maximize results. Concentrate on squeezing the muscles during the active phase to enhance the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26700744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mind-muscle connection</a>.</li><li>Try to add variety to the workouts to target similar muscles differently. For example, use different angles when doing the incline bench press or vary your squat stance (narrow vs. wide).&nbsp;</li><li>In addition to the scheduled weekly rest days, you should also schedule cut-back weeks every 8–12 weeks. In this approach, you will follow your same program but reduce the amount of weight by about half.</li><li>Aim to schedule ab work at the end of a lifting session or on rest days. Light yoga and stretching are also recommended on rest days to promote blood flow to the muscles and enhance recovery.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><p>The PHUL workout split is an intense plan that provides significant rewards. This is tailored to intermediate or advanced lifters, as the format would likely be too intense for beginners to make any meaningful progress. However, if you’re seeking a challenge that takes your routine to the next level, the PHUL workout is for you. </p><p>While there are a variety of programs you can follow for an effective lifting routine, this one provides valuable benefits. You are likely to reach optimal results if you follow our programming guidance while considering our training tips and advice.&nbsp;</p><div class="wp-block-group"><h2 class="wp-block-heading faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1623393125914"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Is a PHUL workout effective?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The PHUL workout split is effective for seasoned gymgoers who want an intense plan that builds muscle and strength.

It works the upper body, lower body, and core in an upper-lower body split. The same weekly workouts are performed in the same order over the eight-week duration.</p><p>The program consists of three sets per exercise performed consecutively. The load increases while the number of reps decreases with each set. Perform the first set with moderately heavy weights, the second with a slightly heavier load, and the third with the heaviest load. The final set should result in muscle failure, where you are unable to complete any more reps.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that when scheduling your sessions, targeted muscle groups need 48–72 hours of rest between workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>A training schedule could look like this:</p><ul><li>Monday: Workout 1</li><li>Tuesday: Workout 2</li><li>Wednesday: Rest</li><li>Thursday: Workout 3</li><li>Friday: Workout 4</li><li>Saturday: Rest</li><li>Sunday: Rest</li></ul><p>Alternatively, you could have two consecutive days and alternate rest and workout days for the remainder of the week.</p><p>Each session ends with <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6355121/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">zone 2 cardio</a> which is low-intensity cardiovascular training at 60%–70% of your heart rate maximum. To figure out the correct heart rate range for your age, substrate your age from 220 and then calculate 60%–70% of that number. Here is an example calculation for a 30-year-old:</p><ul><li>220 - 30 = 190</li><li>190 x 0.6 = 114</li><li>190 x 0.7 = 133</li></ul><p>The zone 2 cardio heart rate range is 114–133 beats per minute.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Workout-1:-Upper-Body">Workout 1: Upper Body</h3><p>Day 1 works the chest, upper back, deltoids, biceps, and triceps.

Each exercise contains a description, step-by-step guide, and expert tips. This provides you with everything you need to create a bodyweight push workout.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Push-Up">Push-Up</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/push-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push-up</a> is a staple upper-body exercise for your calisthenics workout. The primary movers are the pectoralis major muscles. The deltoids, triceps, rectus abdominis, and obliques are the secondary movers.</p><p>The push-up requires the engagement of many push muscles. This makes it great for increasing upper body <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303131/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">training volume</a> and promoting muscle growth. Furthermore, using multiple muscle groups means we can apply significant resistance, which is great for increasing mass and strength.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio vimeo-custom"><iframe 										src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/957562432?title=1&byline=1&portrait=1&dnt=false" 										width="550" 										height="281" 										frameborder="0" 										allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 										allowfullscreen>									</iframe>Push-Up Guide.

Your weight should be resting on the balls of your feet and palms.</li><li>Take a deep breath in and tense your abdominal muscles.</li><li>Allow your elbows to bend and lower your chest toward the floor.</li><li>Lower until your upper arm is parallel to the floor.</li><li>From here, push yourself back up to the beginning position.&nbsp;</li></ol><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tips</h4><ul><li>Keep your hips parallel to the floor and your core engaged for the duration of the set. This will keep your torso rigid.</li><li>Avoid dropping during the lower phase and concentrate on lowering with control. This will help you <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00070/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">develop strength</a>.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Pike-Push-Up">Pike Push-Up</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/pike-push-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pike push-up</a> is a compound movement that angles the torso to place greater emphasis on the shoulders. The primary movers are the deltoids. The secondary movers are the triceps brachii and pectoralis major.</p><p>The inverted position of the pike push-up mimics an overhead press, placing a greater load through the shoulders. Additionally, the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2016/12000/electromyographical_comparison_of_pike_variations.20.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">core muscles</a> including the rectus abdominis, external obliques, and erector spinae must engage to stabilize our torso. This makes it a fantastic full-body exercise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio vimeo-custom"><iframe 										src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/980233068?title=1&byline=1&portrait=1&dnt=false" 										width="550" 										height="281" 										frameborder="0" 										allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 										allowfullscreen>									</iframe>Pike Push-Up Guide. Video: Aliaksandr Makatserchyk</figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">How To Do</h4><ol><li>Kneel down, lean forward, and place your palms flat on the floor.</li><li>Lift your knees off the floor and elevate your hips.&nbsp;</li><li>Your legs and torso form a 90-degree angle with the top of your head facing the floor.</li><li>Inhale and engage your abdominal muscles.</li><li>Bend your elbows and lower yourself until your upper arm is horizontal.</li><li>Then, exhale and push yourself back up to the starting position.</li></ol><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tips</h4><ul><li>Perform static or dynamic hamstring stretches in your warm-up for this exercise. This will lengthen the hamstrings and make it easier to hold the pike position.</li><li>Beginners should perform shallow repetitions and gradually increase depth.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Tricep-Extension">Tricep Extension</h3><p>The tricep extension is a fantastic exercise for increasing arm muscle mass and enhancing our physique. The primary movers are the triceps brachii. The deltoids, rectus abdominis, and obliques are the secondary muscles.</p><p>The narrow arm position limits shoulder involvement, which places greater emphasis on the triceps. Meanwhile, the core muscles must engage to maintain a neutral spine. This makes it one of the great calisthenic isolation exercises which engages the entire body.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio vimeo-custom"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://vimeo.com/1038824677?share=copy</div>Tricep Extension Guide. Video: Aliaksandr Makatserchyk</figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">How To Do</h4><ol><li>Kneel on your mat and place your forearms on the floor so your upper arm remains vertical.</li><li>Inhale, engage your core muscles, and lift your knee off the floor.</li><li>Your weight should be on your forearms and the balls of your feet.</li><li>Exhale, push down with your hands, and lift your elbows off the floor until your elbow is straight.</li><li>Then, gradually lower back to the starting position.</li></ol><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tips&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Keep your forearms parallel and elbows tucked for the duration of the set. This will improve tricep isolation.</li><li>Concentrate on engaging the triceps when the elbow is extended. This will improve your <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26700744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mind-muscle connection</a>, improving results.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Chest-Dip">Chest Dip</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/chest-dip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest dip</a> is a powerful compound exercise for enhancing strength and muscle mass. The primary mover is the pectoralis major. The secondary movers are the deltoids, triceps brachii, and latissimus dorsi.</p><p>The chest dip requires us to support and press our entire body weight. Because it utilizes many muscle groups and joints, it allows us to lift a near-maximal load. This can induce greater effects on <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8126497/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">muscle strength</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio vimeo-custom"><iframe 										src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/969666052?title=1&byline=1&portrait=1&dnt=false" 										width="550" 										height="281" 										frameborder="0" 										allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 										allowfullscreen>									</iframe>Chest Dip Guide. Video: Aliaksandr Makatserchyk</figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">How To Do</h4><ol><li>Standing in front of the dip bars, step up onto each step.</li><li>Grab a handle in each hand with palms facing inwards towards your body.</li><li>Press yourself up so your arms are straight, and take your feet off the steps.</li><li>Angle your torso forward.</li><li>Take a deep breath and tense your core muscles.</li><li>Allow your elbows to bend and lower yourself toward the floor.</li><li>Once your upper arm is horizontal, push yourself back up until your arms are straight.&nbsp;</li></ol><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tips&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Before this exercise, perform a warm-up consisting of arm swings and arm circles to warm up your chest and shoulders.</li><li>Avoid dropping into the dip and focus on gradually lowering yourself. This ensures you are <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00070/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developing strength</a> during the pressing and lower phases.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Decline-Push-Up">Decline Push-Up</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/decline-push-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decline push-up</a> is great for increasing upper chest muscle mass. The primary mover is the pectoralis major. The secondary movers are the deltoids, triceps, rectus abdominis, and obliques.</p><p>The decline push-up requires us to place our feet on a chair and hands on the floor. As we lower our chest toward the floor, there is greater emphasis on the pectoralis major clavicular fibers. This is the upper part of the pectoralis major muscle.</p><p>This is because the decline position resembles the angle of an incline bench press. An incline of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7579505/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">30 degrees</a> results in greater activation of the upper portion of the pectoralis major. This highlights its involvement during the decline push-ups.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio vimeo-custom"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://vimeo.com/980233682?share=copy</div>Decline Push-Up Guide. Video: Aliaksandr Makatserchyk</figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">How To Do</h4><ol><li>Kneel on the floor with your back facing the chair.</li><li>Lean forward and place your palms flat on the floor.</li><li>Lift both of your legs and place your feet on the chair.</li><li>Your weight should now be resting on your palms and the balls of your feet.</li><li>Take a deep breath in and brace your core muscles.</li><li>Allow your elbows to bend and lower your chest toward the floor&nbsp;</li><li>Lower until your upper arm is parallel to the floor.</li><li>Exhale and press yourself back up to the starting position.</li></ol><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tips</h4><ul><li>Place the back of the chair against a wall or hard surface. This will increase stability and prevent it from moving during your set.</li><li>Ensure that your hands are at the same level as your shoulders. This will help create a solid base and improve your pressing ability.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Diamond-Push-Up">Diamond Push-Up</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/diamond-push-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diamond push-up</a> is a variation that increases the difficulty and muscle activation. The primary mover is the pectoralis major. The secondary movers are the deltoids, triceps, rectus abdominis, and obliques.&nbsp;</p><p>The narrow hand position push-up <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4732391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">increases muscle activation</a> of the pectoralis major clavicular head, sternal head, and triceps brachii. During this exercise, they show greater activation compared to other push-up variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The diamond push-up shares a similar hand position, bringing the hand to the midline of the body, shortening the pectoralis major. This allows for greater muscle contraction and highlights how effective it can be for targeting the chest.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio vimeo-custom"><iframe 										src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/980226699?title=1&byline=1&portrait=1&dnt=false" 										width="550" 										height="281" 										frameborder="0" 										allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 										allowfullscreen>									</iframe>Diamond Push-Up Guide. Video: Aliaksandr Makatserchyk</figure><h4 class="wp-block-heading">How To Do</h4><ol><li>Kneel on the floor, lean forward place your palms flat on the floor.</li><li>Position your hands directly below your chest and in the middle.</li><li>Place your thumbs and index finger together to make the shape of a diamond.</li><li>Raise your knees off the floor so your weight rests on your palms and the balls of your feet.</li><li>Breathe in and engage your core muscles.</li><li>Allow your elbows to bend and begin lowering yourself toward the floor.</li><li>Lower until your chest almost makes contact with your hands.</li><li>Then push yourself up to the starting position.</li></ol><h4 class="wp-block-heading">Tips</h4><ul><li>Avoid performing the diamond push-up if you are nursing shoulder and elbow injuries. The narrow hand position can be restrictive and can cause discomfort or aggravation.</li><li>&nbsp;If you cannot perform the diamond push-up, perform the narrow hand position. From here, you can gradually move your hands closer as you build up strength.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Calisthenics Push Workout Routine</h2><p>The workout below combines the six exercises above into the best calisthenics push workout. Its focus is to increase muscle mass and strength. Perform each exercise following the set, repetition, and rest recommendations for the best results.</p><figure class="wp-block-table table-custom h-title table-border" style="font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-weight:500">Calisthenics Push Workout Routine</figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio youtube-custom"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfd4UheX834</div></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">Benefits Of Calisthenics Push Exercises</h2><p>Calisthenics push exercises are great for increasing muscle mass, enhancing strength, and improving body composition. Below we discuss these three benefits.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Increases Muscle Mass</h3><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Increases-Muscle-Mass-endomondo-1.jpg" alt="Increases Muscle Mass" class="wp-image-33644"/>Calisthenics push exercises can increase total training volume, increasing muscle mass. <span>Photo: Wavebreak Media/Freepik</span></figure><p>Developing lean muscle mass requires overloading of muscle tissue at a moderate to high intensity. This can be done by performing <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4592763/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">compound and isolation exercises</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Compound exercise engages more muscles and joints. This allows us to overload our muscles, promoting growth. Meanwhile, isolation exercises provide a targeted approach, enabling us to target increased training volume of specific muscle groups.&nbsp;</p><p>The combination of these types of exercises helps us increase total <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6303131/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">training volume</a>, which can promote hypertrophy.</p><p>The calisthenics push exercises above are excellent examples of compound and isolation exercises. Movements such as push-ups and decline push-ups target multiple muscle groups. On the other hand, tricep extensions provide targeted overload. By combining these exercises, we can increase total training volume, increasing muscle mass.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enhances Strength</h3><p>Enhancing strength requires us to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7927075/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">produce maximum force</a> against an external resistance at a moderate to high intensity. Our chest, shoulders, and triceps are strong, powerful muscle groups that can be exhibited during push exercises.</p><p>These calisthenics push exercises are all great for challenging our push muscles. The chest dip and pike push-up require our chest, shoulders, and triceps to produce maximal force against our body weight. This leads to an increase in strength.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Improves Body Composition</h3><p>Change in <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2020/10000/body_recomposition__can_trained_individuals_build.3.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">body composition</a> requires an increase in lean muscle mass and a decrease in body fat. This is achieved through progressive resistance training and a calorie deficit which is consuming fewer calories than we are burning.&nbsp;</p><p>The calisthenics push workout focuses on compound movements, which engage the entire body. As mentioned, the above exercise applies significant resistance promoting muscle growth.</p><p>This, combined with a calorie deficit and prioritizing complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats can help reduce body fat. This reveals a lean muscular physique.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Expert Training Tips&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>Perform a dynamic stretch warm-up such as arm swings and arm circles, for example, before your calisthenics push workout. This will increase muscle temperature, and prepare joints and the nervous system. This will <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666061X24001664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">improve performance</a> and reduce injury risk.</li><li>Consider performing light cardio and leg swings before your pike push-ups. This will length the hamstrings and make it easier to hold the pick position.</li><li>Concentrate on engaging your target muscle with each repetition. This will enhance your mind-muscle connection, improving your results.</li><li>Focus on completing each movement with the correct technique through its full range of motion. Perform the lowering and pushing phase with control, this helps <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00070/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">develop strength</a>.</li><li>Keep your core engaged for the duration of each set. This will stabilize your torso and spine, reducing unwanted movement. Combining this with correct breathing can increase lifting ability and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4668176/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">improve abdominal fitness</a>.</li><li>At the end of each session perform a cool-down consisting of light cardio and static stretching. Frequent <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/8/2/37#:~:text=All%20studies%20demonstrated%20that%20static,stretching%20versus%20lower%20intensity%20stretching.">static stretching</a> can enhance flexibility and mobility, and improve performance and functional range during daily life.</li><li>If you are experiencing elbow or shoulder pain, consult your physical therapist. They will be able to prescribe alternative exercises and a recovery plan to help you return to exercise safely.</li><li>For effective body recomposition, enter a calorie deficit consisting of nutrient-dense foods and a focus on protein. The <a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-015-0100-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recommended daily protein</a> intake is approximately 1.4–2.0 grams per kilogram of body weight. This will support muscle growth and repair and improve satiety, reducing snacking between meals.</li><li>Allow for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6015912/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">24–72 hours</a> between calisthenics push workouts. This ensures you have enough time between sessions for adequate rest, recovery, and growth.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><p><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/calisthenics-workouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calisthenics workouts</a> are an incredible way to increase muscle mass and strength and develop our physique.
