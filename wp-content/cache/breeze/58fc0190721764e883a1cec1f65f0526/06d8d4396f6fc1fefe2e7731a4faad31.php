					<p>Calisthenics is my go-to training method. It requires little to no equipment, has a short set-up time, and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317321468_The_effects_of_a_calisthenics_training_intervention_on_posture_strength_and_body_composition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">improves body composition</a>. It's well-suited to my travel lifestyle as I'm always on the go.</p><p>I've always used push-up variations for the bulk of my training routine. In a separate article, I’ve looked at the <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/benfits-of-doing-push-up-everday-a-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits of doing push-ups every day for a week</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Following this success, I’m going to be performing <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/reverse-push-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bicep push-ups</a> every day for a month. I’ll perform them over a month with a high training volume and see if I notice any differences.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are my top bicep push-up benefits after a month of performing them!</p><div class="wp-block-group ft-snippet"><p class="has-medium-font-size">5 Benefits Of Doing A Bicep Push-Up Every Day</p><p>Here are the top benefits I experienced after performing bicep push-ups for a month.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#My-Bicep-Strength,-Endurance,-And-Definition-Improved">My bicep strength, endurance, and definition improved.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#It-Helped-With-My-Postural-Awareness">It helped with my postural awareness.&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#My-Joints-Felt-Stronger">My joints felt stronger.&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#My-Functional-Fitness-Felt-Great">My functional fitness felt great.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#It-Boosted-My-Metabolism">It boosted my metabolism.</a></li></ul></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Doing Bicep Push-Ups Every Day For A Month — My Experience</h2><p>Before I get into the key changes, I’ve written down my thoughts and feelings as the challenge progressed. This is to give you a better idea of what to expect if you do it for yourself.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Week 1</h3><p>I perform many <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4732391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">push-up variations</a> in my daily training. So, I’m familiar with most of the new ones I try. However, I haven't really tried this variation much.</p><p>If you compare the movement pattern to a traditional push-up, it’s actually quite a small difference. You point your hands out and keep your elbows tucked in. With this, you perform a bodyweight curl as you lower to the floor.</p><p>Before I started the challenge, I wanted to get used to the general movement. I did a quick <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350401898_Warming-Up_for_Resistance_Training_and_Muscular_Performance_A_Narrative_Review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">warm-up</a> consisting of a treadmill run and dynamic upper-body stretches.&nbsp;</p><p>It took me a couple of sets to get used to the hand position while keeping my elbows tucked. One thing I noticed is that I needed to focus more on controlling the movement. This stopped my elbows from moving out of position and kept the focus on my biceps and chest.</p><p>My goal for this week is to get used to the movement and successfully integrate it into my routine. I’ll start by performing them for four days each week, doing three sets of 20 repetitions in each. Once I’ve perfected the movement, I’ll increase the volume and intensity.&nbsp;</p><p>On that note, if you’re thinking about <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/how-many-push-ups-should-i-be-able-to-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how many push-ups should I be able to do</a>, check out this breakdown.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Week 2&nbsp;</h3><p>At the start of week two, I'm pretty happy with week one’s progress. I feel like I've gotten used to the general movement. I'm enjoying the more controlled nature of keeping my arms in and hands positioned correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn’t think I would find this variation much harder than the normal one. However, to my surprise, I’m really feeling my upper chest and biceps.</p><p>With no real struggles in week one, I’ve decided to increase my volume to three sets of 25 repetitions. I feel like this will provide the right amount of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528903/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">progressive overload</a> needed to push myself to the next level. I’ll keep the weekly workout frequency the same, performing the sessions to fit around my traveling schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>If this week goes well, I’ll increase the intensity in week three.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Week 3&nbsp;</h3><p>Week two was definitely harder due to the increased volume. However, I'm still confident that I can push things even further. These bicep push-ups have been my main bicep exercise so I feel the volume is good for what I need.</p><p>One thing I'm noticing is that I feel more functional. Even though I regularly perform push-ups, this variation offers a welcome change. It’s helping me focus more on my body positioning and core stability.</p><p>Alongside this, I feel like I can already see a difference in my bicep definition. I guess after three weeks, this could be the case.&nbsp;</p><p>I know my bicep strength and endurance have improved. The strict position is teaching me to work on my bicep <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26700744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mind-muscle connection</a>. This helps with activation and, therefore, muscle growth.</p><p>For the last week, I'm going to keep the volume the same but add a weighted vest to provide a bigger intensity for <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4562558/#:~:text=It%20appears%20that%20high-intensity,a%20short-term%20training%20period." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">muscular strength</a>. My goal for the last week is to perform three sets of 25 repetitions.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Week 4</h3><p>I knew it would be hard. However, it was much harder than I thought. Even with my experience, this high-volume, high-intensity work really provided a great challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>My <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cardiovascular system</a> felt like it was getting a good workout. Even my metabolism felt better as I got towards the end of the week.</p><p>I struggled a little bit towards the end of the sets to keep perfect form. The form deviations weren't enough to stop but I did have to adjust a few times. With this, I would say that I’ve completed the challenge successfully and enjoyed some noticeable differences along the way.</p><p>One thing I didn’t expect was an improvement in my posture. Even though my biceps did most of the work, my chest, shoulders, and core also played a role. Strengthening these by using a different push-up variation helped me control my body position out of the gym.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this is because I knew that I needed to keep a tight body position. Without this, I wouldn't keep the correct exercise focus.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">Results And Key Changes&nbsp;</h2><p>These are the key results and changes I experienced after a month of bicep push-ups. You may see similar results and changes with consistent performance using the technique guide below.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="My-Bicep-Strength,-Endurance,-And-Definition-Improved">My Bicep Strength, Endurance, And Definition Improved</h3><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/My-Bicep-Strength-Endurance-And-Definition-Improved-endomondo.jpg" alt="My Bicep Strength, Endurance, And Definition Improved " class="wp-image-34993"/>The bicep push-up can increase bicep strength, endurance, and definition. <span>Photo: freepic.diller/Freepik</span></figure><p>I have a big chest and back but have always struggled with bicep size. I wanted to try bicep push-ups to see if the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372903859_The_Importance_of_Previous_Resistance_Training_Volume_on_Muscle_Growth_in_Trained_Individuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">increased volume</a> and isolation would improve them.</p><p>The hand and elbow positions really challenged my biceps. By week three, I felt a big difference in my bicep endurance and definition. Firstly, my biceps just looked better, especially in a baggy t-shirt. I feel like they’re more in line with my chest size now.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of bicep strength, my normal bicep strength isn’t too bad. That's why I felt a bit frustrated that their size didn't match up. However, even my <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2018/03000/effect_of_progressive_calisthenic_push_up_training.9.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bicep strength improved</a>. I felt stronger performing my usual pull-up movements, even though I regularly do them.</p><p>I guess this shows that using exercise variations to target different parts of your muscle does work.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="It-Helped-With-My-Postural-Awareness">It Helped With My Postural Awareness</h3><p>As I’ve mentioned in other articles, my <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6166197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posture</a> is something I always try to focus on. Years of seated work mean I have to make sure I’m not putting too much pressure on my back.&nbsp;</p><p>Bicep push-ups don’t really focus on posture. However, you do need to slow the movement down and pay attention to core stability to keep a stable position.</p><p>Because of this, I had a better awareness of my body positions at the end of the month. I also found myself thinking more about <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.796097/full#:~:text=Practitioners%20suggest%20that%20a%20strong,the%20occurrence%20of%20back%20pain." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">engaging my core</a> in other exercises even when requiring less stability. This improved my general postural awareness and some low back pain symptoms.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="My-Joints-Felt-Stronger">My Joints Felt Stronger</h3><p>Your <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507893/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">joints</a> are where two bones meet to allow movement. Even though I tend not to have any joint issues, I still make sure my joints are strong. I do this by performing regular exercise and maintaining a good diet.</p><p>Bicep push-ups place a fair amount of pressure on your elbows and wrists. This means you need to focus on the correct technique cues. However, this also means consistent performance will improve joint strength and function.</p><p>At the end of the four weeks, my wrist and elbow joints felt stronger and more functional. With this, I think it's good to perform general exercises with targeted exercises in between. It allows well-rounded development while also developing other important aspects.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="My-Functional-Fitness-Felt-Great">My Functional Fitness Felt Great</h3><p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2022.882195/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Functional fitness</a> refers to doing exercises that improve performance in everyday tasks. Good functional fitness means you’re able to execute basic movement patterns with good mobility.&nbsp;</p><p>My functional fitness is generally good. I perform a lot of calisthenic training, which consists of functional bodyweight movements.</p><p>Despite this, adding the bicep push-ups into my routine made a difference. The slight change in weight distribution and lever length provided an added functional challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>My functional fitness felt better than ever! I’ll certainly be considering it as part of my future routines.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="It-Boosted-My-Metabolism">It Boosted My Metabolism</h3><p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7545035/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metabolism</a> is an important process that’s constantly taking place in the body. It breaks down nutrients, rebuilds, and repairs body tissues, and helps to remove toxins. Increasing it can make these processes more efficient.&nbsp;</p><p>I found that even as a bodyweight movement, bicep push-ups challenged my cardiovascular fitness. This was especially the case when I added the weighted vest. The increased exercise intensity and high volume were enough to achieve this.</p><p>At the end of the challenge, I felt more efficient at burning energy because of the challenging stimulus it provided. This means bicep push-ups can be a great addition when included in a well-rounded routine.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-end">How To Do A Bicep Push-Up</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned about my experiences and benefits, here are the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/9/1/9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">technique cues</a> I used throughout the challenge. Using the correct exercise technique is important to ensure target muscle focus.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio vimeo-custom"><iframe 										src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1015534446?title=1&byline=1&portrait=1&dnt=false" 										width="550" 										height="281" 										frameborder="0" 										allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 										allowfullscreen>									</iframe>Bicep Push-Up Guide. Video: Aliaksandr Makatserchyk</figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading">How To Do</h3><ol><li>Set up next to a mat or padded area. Assume a tabletop position similar to how you would in a normal push-up. Your hands and knees should be on the ground with your shoulders over your hands.</li><li>Bring your legs back straight with your feet together. You should be on the balls of your feet.</li><li>With your arms hip-width apart, bring your hands back to lower chest height. Point your hands out to your sides while keeping your elbows in.</li><li>Keep a straight line from your head to your heels. Focus on a point on the ground in front of you.&nbsp;</li><li>Inhale and engage your core. Exhale and bend your elbows to come down to the ground. Keep your elbows tucked in.&nbsp;</li><li>Pause briefly at the bottom position before your chest touches the floor.&nbsp;</li><li>Inhale and push through your hands to return to the starting position.&nbsp;</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips</h3><ul><li><strong>Keep Your Elbows Tucked In — </strong>Keeping your elbows tucked into your sides ensures target focus on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519538/#:~:text=Structure%20and%20Function&text=The%20biceps%20brachii%20is%20primarily,the%20shoulder%20joint's%20dynamic%20stability." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">biceps brachii</a>. Focus on their position for both phases of the movement. Stop and reassess your form if you notice your elbows flaring.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Maintain Core Engagement — </strong>The change in weight distribution adds more instability. Maintaining core engagement allows you to keep a stable body position.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Perform A Suitable Warm-Up — </strong>The wrist position increases the amount of wrist stress compared to the normal push-up. Approximately <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8038891/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20.4%</a> of CrossFit athletes reported a hand or wrist injury. Ensure you perform some dynamic wrist stretches before your push-ups.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Maintain A Neutral Neck Position — </strong>Avoid letting your neck extend or tucking your chin. Focus on a point in front of you as you perform both movement phases.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h2><p>I'm sure most of you know about push-up variations, even if you don’t regularly use them. However, the bicep push-up is a variation that often flies under the radar.&nbsp;</p><p>After four weeks of performing them, I can say for sure they deserve more attention. They provide a great way to isolate the biceps while working the chest and shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>Add them to your routine and see what you think!&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1623393125914"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Do bicep push-ups really work?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Bicep push-ups are a great way to work the biceps brachii muscles while improving general fitness and function.

					<p>Despite its simplicity, the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275023773_The_Push_-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">push-up</a> remains a foundational movement in many bodyweight workouts. Even in gym routines, it’s often added towards the end of sessions or as part of a circuit. It's easy to perform, requires no equipment, and has several useful variations.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/benefits-of-push-ups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits of push-ups</a> are clear. They improve muscle mass, muscular strength, and reduce injury risk when correctly programmed. Because of this, they’re certain considerations to make when it comes to programming.&nbsp;</p><p>Questions such as how many push ups a day to see results need to be discussed. This ensures that you get the most out of your push-up program.&nbsp;</p><p>In the article below, we discuss the correct amount of push-ups to perform. We look at plan structure, training tips, and common mistakes to avoid. By the end of the article, you’ll be a push-up expert!&nbsp;</p><div class="wp-block-group ft-snippet"><p class="has-medium-font-size">How Many Push Ups Should You Do A Day?</p><p>The push-up is a simple bodyweight movement that offers several benefits. These include improved strength, increased muscle mass, and lower injury risk. Thus, it makes a worthwhile program addition.&nbsp;</p><p>So, how many push ups a day to see results? The answer depends on your ability level and training goals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Perform 50</strong>–<strong>100 daily push-ups that are broken down into manageable sets. These can be organized according to your ability level or training style.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Track your progress using online apps or write your sets down in a diary.&nbsp;</p><p>Integrate different <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/push-up-variations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push-up variations</a> as needed, following the correct technique cues and tips for efficient performance.</p></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Many Push-Ups A Day To See Results In 30 Days?</h2><p>You can program your daily push-ups according to your stage of training or training goals. This means that you can use your ability level or training style to set the correct training intensity and volume.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a beginner won’t be able to perform as many push-ups as an advanced lifter. Therefore, the push-up sets will need to use a smaller training volume.&nbsp;</p><p>Someone training for strength and power will perform less volume than someone who is training for endurance and hypertrophy. This is because their training intensity will be higher for the rest of their training. To increase the difficulty, a weighted vest can be used.&nbsp;</p><p>The following guidelines can be used according to your ability level:</p><ul><li><strong>Beginner — </strong>2–5 sets x 10 repetitions.</li><li><strong>Intermediate — </strong>2–5 sets x 10–15 repetitions.</li><li><strong>Advanced — </strong>2–5 sets x 10–20 repetitions.</li></ul><p>Each of the ranges above will put you in the suggested 50–100 daily push-ups range. The beginner lifter range puts you near the bottom of the suggested daily repetitions. The advanced lifter range puts you near the top of the suggested repetitions.&nbsp;</p><p>As you’ll see in the example workout below, these can easily be applied to a 30-day push-up plan.&nbsp;</p><p>In this, you’ll change the ranges each week to provide a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9528903/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">progressive overload stimulus</a>. This refers to the deliberate manipulation of training variables such as intensity and volume to promote adaptations in the body. These include physical determinants such as muscle growth and muscular strength.&nbsp;</p><p>Spacing these sets evenly across the day can help limit fatigue and provide sufficient recovery between sets. This also gives you more freedom, allowing you to perform them at home, on the go, or in the gym. If you want to perform them in one session, ensure at least 60–90 seconds of rest between sets.&nbsp;</p><p>If you struggle to hit any of the suggested ranges, reassess your ability level. For example, you may need to be performing the beginner ranges if you can perform the intermediate ones with good form. If you find that you can easily perform the suggested ranges, you might need to go up a level.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-medium-font-size">Training Style&nbsp;</p><p>These are the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927075/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suggested sets and reps</a> according to your training style. This can be used if you’re adding push-ups into your training rather than as a stand-alone challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>These should be seen as general guidelines rather than absolute values. Your training may use a mix of different ranges depending on the exercise.</p><p>In this case, they can be programmed as part of a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5556132/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">superset</a> if your main goal is to increase training volume. This is where you perform two exercises in a row with no rest.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">How To Structure A 30-Day Push-Up Plan</h2><p>Correctly structuring a 30-day push-up plan requires you to manipulate the main training principles while sticking to the exercise basics. This means that you’ll need to either change the volume, intensity, frequency, or variation. These refer to the amount of work, exercise difficulty, times you perform the exercises, and variations of the normal push-up.</p><p>To start with, you’ll want to assess your basic push-up level with a test. This can be done using the simple method below. This number can be used to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254623000601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">program the main principles</a> when designing your push-up plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have this number, set your workout volume, frequency, and variations. The points below can be used as general guidelines. The important thing is that you apply your test number:</p><ul><li>Aim to perform 50–100 push-ups as a general goal. Where you are on this range will be determined by your ability level and goals. For example, if you struggle to perform a set of 20 push-ups, you’ll be aiming for the lower end of the range.</li><li>Perform the push-ups throughout the day, splitting them into manageable sets. This helps to spread the workload and minimize the chances of fatigue.&nbsp;</li><li>This push-up workout can be performed daily. However, make sure you manage the volume appropriately. This limits the risks of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/24/12509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">overtraining</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>The push-up variations can be programmed according to your ability level and goals. For example, the decline push-up provides an easier variation. The spider push-up is a slightly harder variation that provides an additional core challenge.&nbsp;</li><li>As an advanced athlete, you can perform the push-ups as part of a <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/best-push-day-workout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push day workout</a>. Your ability level means that you can perform a larger training volume.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Assess Your Level With A Test</h3><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Training And Recovery Tips</h3><p>Follow these training and recovery tips when looking to improve your push-up number. These same tips can be applied to most exercise routines.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Prioritize Proper Exercise Technique — </strong>Proper exercise technique <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/9/1/9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ensures efficient movement patterns</a>. Follow the form tips above for proper performance. Adjust the training volume if you notice form deviations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Change The Exercise Variables As Needed — </strong>The exercise volume, intensity, and type of variation can be changed as needed. This will depend on your progress, form, and test numbers. There can be changes during each 30 days if needed.</li><li><strong>Use The Push-up Variations — </strong>Push-up variations can be used to change the difficulty level and shift the target muscle focus. Use them according to your exercise goals and ability level.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Perform A Suitable Warm-up — </strong>Perform a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350401898_Warming-Up_for_Resistance_Training_and_Muscular_Performance_A_Narrative_Review#:~:text=Warming-up%20is%20an%20indispensable,the%20effects%20on%20force%20production." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">warm-up</a> before every push-up session. This helps to increase body temperature, loosen joints, and improve blood flow. This should consist of aerobic exercise and dynamic stretches.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Give Yourself Sufficient Rest — </strong>Make sure you allow at least 60–90 seconds of rest between sets. Shorter rest periods <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6316470/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">may interfere</a> with resistance training adaptations that need time to take place. This means your muscles can replenish their energy stores and eliminate waste product build-up so they can maintain performance.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common Mistakes To Avoid</h2><p>While the push-up uses a simple movement pattern, it's easy to get wrong if you’re not aware of the common mistakes. Take a look at the main ones below so you can avoid them when performing your 30-day push-up plan.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Poor Exercise Technique — </strong>Failure to follow the correct technique cues can reduce exercise focus and increase injury risk. The number of individuals with injuries (prevalence) across different weight training sports was estimated at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10099898/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">10%–82%</a>. Common mistakes include letting the hips drop, touching the floor with the chest, and incorrect breathing.</li><li><strong>Incorrect Programming — </strong>Use the baseline push-up test to inform your 30-day programming. Adjust your training volume, intensity, and variations as needed.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Not Enough Rest — </strong>Ensure you split the push-ups into manageable sets. Allow a suitable rest period between each set, splitting them up across the day if possible.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">How To Track Your Progress</h2><p>If you want to see results, you need to track your progress. This allows you to adjust the workout variables according to the previous week's progress. Integrate the tracking methods below as needed.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep A Workout Journal — </strong>Record the number of sets, reps, and variations performed. Note any improvements or deviations in form. Make sure you record the time and date to reference.</li><li><strong>Use A Fitness Application — </strong>Most <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1281323/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">popular fitness apps</a> include a handy tracking tool that allows you to input your daily workout data. This can be used on your mobile phone. Workout reminders and goals can be set as needed.</li><li><strong>Enlist The Help Of A Professional — </strong>A personal trainer can track your progress and keep you accountable. Enlist the help of a qualified professional in your home or a commercial gym setting.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><p>The push-up remains a staple workout exercise that offers several useful benefits when programmed correctly. Use the 30-day push-up challenge to improve the number of push-ups you can perform. Correctly integrate the main workout variables using the guidance above, using 50–100 push-ups as a general daily target.</p><p>Follow the training and recovery tips to limit the risk of overtraining and injury.

					<p>Push-ups are a huge part of my routine. I’ve tried many different variations in previous challenges. While I’ve found each one hard, I’ve managed to complete them and see some awesome benefits along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>As I’ve mentioned before, my chest is pretty big but my arms and shoulders are lagging. Because of this, I’ve wanted to work on my shoulders using an accessible movement that I can do when traveling. Introducing the <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/handstand-push-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handstand push-up</a>!</p><p>I’ve enjoyed doing them occasionally but never properly used them in a routine. Even though I would say I'm at an intermediate level, I still find them hard. Because of this, I’ll use the wall for assistance.</p><p>My aim for this challenge is to perform three sets of 10 repetitions every day. I’ll space them throughout the day if possible to reduce the chances of fatigue. Let’s see how I get on! Here are my handstand push-up benefits after a month.</p><div class="wp-block-group ft-snippet"><p class="has-medium-font-size">5 Benefits Of Doing A Handstand Push-Up Every Day</p><p>I noticed these five benefits after doing handstand push-ups every day for a month. I split my sets throughout the day, performing them anywhere I could.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#My-Upper-Body-Strength-Improved">My upper-body strength improved.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#My-Shoulder-Mobility-Felt-Better">My shoulder mobility felt better.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#My-Core-Stability-And-Balance-Was-Much-Better">My core stability and balance was much better.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#My-Full-Body-Coordination-Was-Challenged-">My full-body coordination was challenged.&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#The-Functional-Strength-Element-Was-Great">The functional strength element was great.</a></li></ul></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Doing Handstand Push-Ups Every Day For A Month — My Experience&nbsp;</h2><p>Below are my thoughts and feelings throughout the challenge to give you a better idea of what you might experience.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Week 1</h3><p>The aim of this week is to get used to the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/abstract/2019/04000/exercise_technique__handstand_push_up.16.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">general technique</a>. While it’s quite a simple movement pattern, it requires a lot of strength, balance, and coordination. I’m performing them daily, so the main consideration is finding a suitable wall. As I’m traveling around, I should have no problem with this.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start with three sets of five reps until I’m really confident I can use the correct technique. I think this should be the right training volume to start. Speaking of volume, if you're wondering <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/how-many-push-ups-should-i-be-able-to-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how many push-ups should I be able to do</a>, check out this article.&nbsp;</p><p>After a few days, I’m definitely getting used to the general movement. The main thing I’m struggling with is finding the right starting point to kick up to the wall. I reckon I’ll have this down once I get to the end of the week.&nbsp;</p><p>Even at five reps, I’m surprised at how much they work my shoulders. What a great upper-body movement with an added core challenge!&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Week 2&nbsp;</h3><p>At the start of week two, I definitely feel like I’ve got the general technique down. I’ve got a better idea of the spacing from the wall and how to keep balanced.&nbsp;</p><p>With this, it’s time to increase my training volume to my target repetitions. I know that progressively increasing this is a great way to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6303131/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20changes%20in%20muscle%20strength,in%20markers%20of%20muscle%20hypertrophy." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ensure muscle growth</a>. My target for week two is three sets of ten repetitions. I think I’ll find it hard but I’m ready for the challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m at the end of week two and, therefore, halfway through the challenge. All I can say is wow! What a difference an extra five repetitions make.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m glad I set ten as the target because that will be my limit for this challenge. I’ve found that I start to struggle at around eight, especially towards set three. Because of this, three sets of ten is definitely the right level of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528903/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">progressive overload</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In week three, I’m hoping to start seeing some real differences. Let’s see what happens!&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Week 3&nbsp;</h3><p>For week three, I’m keeping the volume the same but looking to improve my technique at the end of the sets. I’m on a big trip this week to do some hiking. However, as long as I can find a wall, I’m good to go.</p><p>One thing that surprised me is the amount of core strength I’m using. Keeping a balanced position is challenging. Because of this, I know my core stability and balance are improving.&nbsp;</p><p>At the start of week three, I’ve noticed that my shoulder strength has also improved. Even though it’s a bodyweight movement, I’m literally pressing my whole body in the air. Therefore, it’s at a high enough intensity for strength improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>Wearing a weight vest would be a great way to increase the intensity further. However, I think this would be too much for me right now. It’s important to manage rest and recovery to avoid possible injury. The shoulders are one of the most commonly injured muscle groups, accounting for <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376199974_Prevalence_and_Pattern_of_Injuries_Across_the_Weight-Training_Sports#:~:text=The%20body%20parts%20most%20injured,injuries%20(2.3%25)%20were%20reported." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">7.4%</a> of all injuries.</p><p>This week was challenging for me. However, I've enjoyed being able to exercise anywhere I want. Splitting the sets throughout the day was a great idea.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Week 4</h3><p>It's the last week of the challenge and I'm ready to have a perfect week. My technique is sorted and I'm noticing the physical differences. I’m also enjoying the extra upper-body work.</p><p>One thing I've noticed this week is that my shoulders feel more mobile. Even when I'm doing normal press-ups, they move around more freely without too much of a warm-up. I’ll need to keep <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350401898_Warming-Up_for_Resistance_Training_and_Muscular_Performance_A_Narrative_Review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">warming up before exercise</a> but this is a great sign of better shoulder mobility.</p><p>I'm hoping my full-body coordination has also improved. I'm finding the movement easier compared to week one so I guess it must have. When thinking about it, you need to coordinate your upper body, core, and lower body, making it a full-body exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the challenge, I’m really glad I chose the handstand push-up. I think it's a well-rounded bodyweight movement worth including in any routine.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">Results And Key Changes</h2><p>These are the five key changes I noticed when performing the challenge. Hopefully, you’ll experience them as well!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="My-Upper-Body-Strength-Improved">My Upper Body Strength Improved</h3><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/My-Upper-Body-Strength-Improved-endomondo.jpg" alt="My Upper Body Strength Improved " class="wp-image-35696"/>The handstand push-up helps improve shoulder strength. <span>Photo: lunamarina/Freepik</span></figure><p>My upper-body strength is generally quite good. I do a lot of push-ups, including different <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/push-up-progression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push-up progression</a> routines. However, the shoulders tend to be secondary movers in most push-up movements.</p><p>Building strength requires a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4562558/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suitable training intensity</a>. The fact that you need to press your whole body weight vertically in the handstand push-up provides it.</p><p>Because of this, my shoulder strength really improved over the four-week challenge. I'm sure this would mean that my other upper-body movements would also feel easier.&nbsp;</p><p>What's great about the handstand push-up is that I’m not even at my maximum intensity yet. I can still increase my volume and add a weighted vest when needed. The possibilities of this versatile movement are endless.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="My-Shoulder-Mobility-Felt-Better">My Shoulder Mobility Felt Better</h3><p>Shoulder mobility refers to the flexibility and range of motion of your shoulder joints. Having good mobility means they can move using a large range of motion with few restrictions.</p><p>I would describe my shoulder mobility as average or maybe even good. I regularly work out and move around. However, there's definitely room for improvement.&nbsp;</p><p>The handstand push-up requires large degrees of shoulder flexion and extension. This means the arms come in front and behind the body.</p><p>Because of the large shoulder movement, my shoulder mobility felt really good at the end of the challenge. Both shoulders moved through their full ranges of motion with less restriction.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, other exercises and general movements felt more natural and controlled. Upper body resistance training using large ranges of motion seems to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/4/1028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">improve shoulder mobility</a>!&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="My-Core-Stability-And-Balance-Was-Much-Better">My Core Stability And Balance Was Much Better</h3><p>Core stability is needed for <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.796097/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several important functions</a>. It helps to maintain control during movement, exercise, and activity. It plays a leading role in how our limbs and body move in relation to the forces applied to it.&nbsp;</p><p>My core stability isn’t bad at all. I regularly perform core strengthening work, which includes <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37815235/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">plank variations</a>. However, I certainly wasn’t prepared for the stability and balance requirements of the handstand push-up.</p><p>After three weeks of practice and perfection, my core stability and balance really started to improve. With this, I felt more balanced and under control during both phases. This helped me to perfect my technique and focus more on my upper body movements.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re looking for a core stability and balance challenge, try this! It could even help to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.796097/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">improve your sports performance</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="My-Full-Body-Coordination-Was-Challenged-">My Full-Body Coordination Was Challenged&nbsp;</h3><p>In a previous article, I looked at the <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/benfits-of-doing-push-up-everday-a-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits of doing push-ups every day for a week</a>. In this, I mentioned they required full-body coordination. Even with this, they have nothing on the handstand push-up.</p><p>During each repetition, you need to keep your core engaged, hold a straight leg position, and bend both arms. While doing this, it’s also important to maintain a neutral head position.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the challenge, my full-body coordination improved. The different elements of the handstand push-up provide a suitable challenge. Because of this, I <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966636220302629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">felt more coordinated</a> during everyday movement and activity, including when playing sports.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-Functional-Strength-Element-Was-Great">The Functional Strength Element Was Great</h3><p>Functional strength development is important to me. It refers to the ability of your body to perform everyday tasks and activities against resistance. <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/3/1074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Better functional strength</a> means you’ll find daily living much easier.&nbsp;</p><p>As I regularly travel, I’m always exercising, hiking, and climbing. Therefore, my level of functional strength plays a big role in everything I do.&nbsp;</p><p>The handstand push-up is a great functional exercise. It uses the shoulders and chest muscles to <a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/fulltext/2022/07000/shareable_resource__functional_fitness__strong_for.4.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">push your body</a> away from the floor. Examples of similar movements include pushing a door open or pushing off the floor when lying down.&nbsp;</p><p>This element improved my functional strength by the end of the challenge.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-end">How To Do A Handstand Push-Up&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio vimeo-custom"><iframe 										src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1008682697?title=1&byline=1&portrait=1&dnt=false" 										width="550" 										height="281" 										frameborder="0" 										allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" 										allowfullscreen>									</iframe>Handstand Push-Up&nbsp;Guide. Video: Aliaksandr Makatserchyk</figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading">How To Do</h3><ol><li>Set up next to a suitable wall in a large space. Check that the wall is well-built and free from any obstructions.</li><li>Stand facing away from the wall with your feet hip-width apart. Your head should be approximately 10 inches from the wall.&nbsp;</li><li>Inhale and engage your core. Place both hands on the ground in front of you hip-width apart.</li><li>Kick one leg back onto the wall. Perform the same movement with the other leg before bringing your hands back towards the wall. Walk up the wall with your legs at the same time.</li><li>Stop when your hands are around 6 inches away from the wall. Your legs should be vertical with your hands stacked under your shoulders.&nbsp;</li><li>Exhale and flex your elbows to lower down to the ground. Pause briefly at the bottom position before your head touches the ground.&nbsp;</li><li>Extend your elbow to bring your body back to the starting position, inhaling at the same time.&nbsp;</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips</h3><ul><li>Use a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8310485/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">slow, controlled tempo</a> for each repetition. Both phases of the movement should be carried out at the same speed to maintain balance and control.&nbsp;</li><li>Avoid moving your hands once in the starting position. This helps to avoid any excess stress and potential injury, Check your hand positions before bending your elbows.&nbsp;</li><li>Keep your core engaged throughout each repetition. This helps to maintain a stable body position and ensures primary muscle focus.&nbsp;</li><li>Engage your shoulder muscles as you push back to the starting position, This helps to develop a better <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26700744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mind-muscle connection</a> which can improve muscle growth.&nbsp;</li><li>Avoid tucking or overextending your neck. Your head should remain in a neutral position throughout both phases of the movement. This prevents excessive neck strain and potential injury.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h2><p>The handstand push-up is a challenging bodyweight movement that's well worth adding to your workout routine. It requires full body strength, mobility, coordination, and core stability. Because of this, it's a versatile exercise that offers well-rounded development with consistent performance.</p><p>Whenever I see a wall, I’ll add some repetitions to my daily routine. If you don't have access to a gym or prefer bodyweight movements, this has to be on the list. Hopefully, in the future, I’ll progress to using a weighted vest or no wall. For now, though, I’m pleased with my overall progress and will recommend this movement to anyone I meet!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1623393125914"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Are handstand push-ups effective?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Handstand push-ups are an effective exercise for building upper-body strength and mobility.

Decline push-ups target the upper chest and shoulders, while chin-ups focus on lats and biceps for balanced strength. Triceps dips isolate the triceps for targeted strength-building, and inverted rows hit the upper back and biceps, promoting a strong posture.&nbsp;</p><p>Push-ups work the entire upper body, particularly the chest, shoulders, and triceps, making them a versatile staple. Finally, planks engage the core, building the stability for all upper-body movements.</p><div class="wp-block-group medicine-table no-scroll"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lower A</h3><p>This workout targets the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves through compound lower-body movements. It aims to build leg strength and muscle while enhancing balance and stability. Key muscles worked include quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteus maximus, and calves, with core engagement enhancing lower-body stability and control.</p><p>The selected exercises challenge these muscles through a variety of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/3/1074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">functional movements</a>. Squats are a staple for overall lower-body development, focusing primarily on the quads and glutes while engaging the core.&nbsp;</p><p>Single-leg Romanian deadlifts work the hamstrings and glutes while also <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10133687/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">improving balance</a>. Lunges hit the quads, hamstrings, and glutes from different angles, promoting functional strength and stability.</p><p>Glute bridges isolate the glutes, strengthening hip extension, which is essential for power and stability. Calf raises target the calves, enhancing strength and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ca.23855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">power</a> for a balanced lower body. Lastly, crunches add core work, reinforcing the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.915259/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stability</a> needed for effective lower-body movements and proper lifting mechanics.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Upper B</h3><p>This workout day is designed to strengthen the upper body’s pulling muscles, mainly targeting the back and biceps. Handstand push-ups focus on the shoulders, triceps, and upper chest.&nbsp;</p><p>Pull-ups target the back, biceps, and forearms. Pike push-ups are a progression towards handstand push-ups, targeting the shoulders and triceps. Inverted rows add more back, biceps, and rear delt work and are done for higher reps to build <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7927075/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">muscular endurance</a>. Additional <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/calisthenics-back-workout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calisthenics back workouts</a> are available, offering targeted options to strengthen and develop this specific muscle group effectively.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.915259/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Core stability</a> is also a focus of this workout. Russian twists strengthen the obliques and build rotational core control. They stabilize the spine, reducing energy loss during exertion. Integrated core workouts optimize athletic performance, making them essential for daily training routines.</p><p>Triceps dips round out the workout by building endurance in the triceps, chest, and shoulders. Together, these exercises build upper-body pulling strength and core stability. There are many variations of <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/calisthenics-shoulder-workout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calisthenics shoulder workouts</a> to adapt and interchange, catering to various skill levels and training goals.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lower B</h3><p>This workout focuses on lower body power and stability using a mix of unilateral and explosive movements. Key muscles worked include the quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves, and core. The goal is to build both strength and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9832201/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">athleticism</a>, emphasizing stability and endurance to support functional movement.</p><p>Squats are the cornerstone of <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/calisthenics-leg-workout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calisthenics leg workouts</a>, using higher reps to build leg endurance and stamina.

This structure uses only bodyweight exercises, meaning you’re not limited to gyms or expensive equipment. Adapt your workout easily at home, outdoors, or in a hotel, removing the need for conventional gym settings.</p><p>Exercises such as squats, push-ups, and planks require minimal space and can be performed virtually anywhere. This flexibility suits travelers, parents, and those without gym access, making fitness easy to incorporate daily.&nbsp;</p><p>A 4-day split ensures total muscle engagement, keeping you on track and avoiding missed workouts while on the go. This flexibility and ease make the upper/lower split ideal for anyone looking to build a sustainable, location-independent workout habit.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Build Muscle And Lose Weight</h3><p>The upper/lower calisthenics split is a powerful way to build muscle and lose weight without needing weights or machines. Calisthenics exercises stimulate muscle growth by challenging multiple muscle groups in each workout. Training each muscle group <a href="https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-022-00481-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">twice weekly </a>ensures consistent stimulation, which promotes muscle building and increased strength.</p><p>Calisthenics exercises are also excellent for fat-burning. High-intensity bodyweight exercises in an upper/lower split increase heart rate, maximizing calorie burn during and post-workout.&nbsp;</p><p>Exercises like lunges and push-ups also activate core muscles, adding stability and increasing overall calorie expenditure. By focusing on compound movements, the workout effectively builds lean muscle mass, which in turn boosts <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00032/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">metabolism</a>, supporting weight loss goals.&nbsp;</p><p>This approach makes the upper/lower split a balanced, efficient way to improve body composition and achieve a leaner, stronger physique.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Workout Flexibility</h3><p>The upper/lower split offers great flexibility, fitting seamlessly into your schedule while allowing time for rest and recovery. Training four days a week provides ample opportunities to adjust workout days around personal and work commitments. This flexibility ensures you can progress without sacrificing balance in other areas of your life, making it easier to stay consistent.</p><p>Additionally, bodyweight calisthenics removes the need for a gym, allowing you to complete your workout whenever and wherever is most convenient. For people with tight schedules, this flexibility reduces missed sessions, helping you maintain a sustainable, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5556592/#:~:text=Consistently%20performing%20exercise%20of%20a,to%20discontinue%20their%20exercise%20program." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">long-term fitness </a>routine.&nbsp;</p><p>Each workout is quick, allowing you to maximize strength gains without taking excessive time. The adaptability of this split plan provides both the freedom and structure needed for balanced, efficient progress.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">Tips To Make The Most Of Your Calisthenics Workout Routine</h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Aim For Proper Form</h3><p>Proper form is the foundation of effective calisthenics training. It ensures maximum muscle engagement and minimizes injury risk. Focus on maintaining correct alignment and controlled movements throughout each exercise. This will lead to better results and safer workouts.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Progressive Overload</h3><p>Continuous improvement in calisthenics requires <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528903/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">progressive overload</a>. Gradually increase the difficulty of your workouts over time. This can be achieved by adding reps, sets, or advancing to more challenging exercise variations.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rest & Recovery</h3><p>Recovery is crucial for muscle growth and strength gains. Prioritize sleep and proper nutrition to maximize your calisthenics progress:</p><ul><li>Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to allow your body to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8072992/">repair and rebuild </a>muscle tissue. This helps release growth hormones essential for muscle development and overall recovery.&nbsp;</li><li>Time your meals strategically, especially around workouts. Consume a combination of protein and carbohydrates <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5596471/">within 2 hours</a> post-exercise to optimize recovery. This provides essential nutrients for muscle repair, promoting consistent progress in your calisthenics workouts.</li></ul><p>While consistency is key, it's also important to recognize when you need extra rest. If you're feeling excessively fatigued or experiencing persistent pain, take a day off or reduce workout intensity. If there is pain, seek out guidance from a medical professional such as a physical therapist.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Focus On Mind-Muscle Control</h3><p>In calisthenics, the quality of your movements matters more than the number of repetitions. Concentrate on performing each rep with control and precision. This approach ensures better muscle engagement and reduces the risk of injury.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2><p>This comprehensive calisthenics workout plan provides an effective framework for building strength and muscle using just your body weight. The upper/lower split allows for balanced, full-body training while providing adequate recovery between sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>By consistently following this routine and progressively overloading the exercises, you can transform your physique and improve overall fitness. Remember to focus on proper form, gradually increase difficulty, and allow for sufficient rest and recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>The versatility of calisthenics means you can perform these workouts anywhere, making it easier to stay consistent with your training. With dedication, patience, and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/structured-literature-review-on-the-role-of-mindfulness-mindful-eating-and-intuitive-eating-in-changing-eating-behaviours-effectiveness-and-associated-potential-mechanisms/351A3D01E43F49CC9794756BC950EFFC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proper nutrition</a>, you'll be amazed at what your body can achieve through the power of calisthenics.

					<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is, without a doubt, the greatest bodybuilder to ever walk among us. He was a giant amongst giants known for his ability to carry vast amounts of muscle mass and perfect the male physique. As such, it makes sense that bodybuilders of all ages would want to train like Arnold did. Luckily, we have a pretty good idea of how he trained and what he did to achieve this greatness.</p><p>Like any other efficient bodybuilder, Arnold used various <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/workouts/3-day-workout-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workout plans</a> in his training career. Everything from your classic “bro split” to even training twice a day, Arnold did it. However, one of his favorite workout splits has been dubbed the Arnold split. This six-day program will help you break through plateaus and add slabs of lean muscle mass to your frame, just like the master himself.</p><div class="wp-block-group box-grey"><p class="has-medium-font-size">Arnold Split Workout Routine</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-One:-Chest-And-Back-1">Day one: Chest And Back 1</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-Two:-Shoulders-And-Arms-1">Day two: Shoulders And Arms 1</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day%20Three:%20Legs%201">Day three: Legs 1</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day%20Four:%20Chest%20And%20Back%202">Day four: Chest And Back 2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-Five:-Shoulders-And-Arms-2">Day five: Shoulders And Arms 2</a></li><li><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/#Day-Six:-Legs-2">Day six: Legs 2</a></li></ul></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Six-Day Arnold Split For Lean Muscle Mass</h2><p>You may be surprised to see so many simple workouts below, but it was these simple workouts that carried Arnold Schwarzenegger to the top. The secret lies not in complexity, but in the exercise rotation and consistency.</p><p>One common mistake people make when trying to follow this training split is using isolation exercises. While Arnold did do isolation exercises, the Arnold split focuses on using basic compound exercises, which he relied heavily on. This includes exercises such as the barbell bench press and squats.</p><p>While we don’t have time to go through the specifics of all the exercises, below are some of the most popular ones for each muscle group. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-One:-Chest-And-Back-1">Day One: Chest And Back 1</h3><p><a href="https://www.endomondo.com/exercise/chest-workout-routine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chest exercises</a> are a fundamental component of any well-rounded fitness routine. These exercises primarily target the pectoral muscles, which play a crucial role in upper body strength and aesthetics. They can help with improved upper body strength, enhanced posture, a more sculpted chest appearance, and increased functional fitness for daily activities.</p><p>Strengthening your back muscles can improve posture, reduce the risk of injury, and alleviate back pain. Additionally, a strong back supports proper spine alignment and enhances stability. These exercises target the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and other key muscle groups, promoting a well-balanced physique.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-Two:-Shoulders-And-Arms-1">Day Two: Shoulders And Arms 1</h3><p>This workout is meticulously designed to sculpt and strengthen the shoulders and biceps, focusing on muscle definition and endurance. Initiating the session with the Military Press, a cornerstone exercise, targets the entire shoulder complex and triceps, enhancing overhead pressing strength and shoulder stability. Transitioning to Lateral Raises, the emphasis shifts to the shoulder's medial deltoids, critical for achieving that sought-after shoulder width and separation. </p><p>The workout then moves onto the biceps with the Barbell Curl, a quintessential movement for mass building, focusing on the biceps brachii's peak and overall arm girth. Preacher Curls follow, isolating the biceps to prevent momentum usage, ensuring targeted tension and promoting superior bicep growth and shape. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-Three:-Legs-1">Day Three: Legs 1</h3><p>These exercises improve stability, enhance athletic performance, and aid in weight management by torching calories. Strengthening your legs also promotes better posture and reduces the risk of injury in daily activities.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-Four:-Chest-And-Back-2">Day Four: Chest And Back 2</h3><p>Day Four revisits the chest and back with a new set of exercises to further challenge these major muscle groups. </p><p>This session introduces variations like a decline bench press and seated cable rows, targeting different angles and promoting muscle growth through diverse stimuli. The inclusion of exercises like chest dips and deadlifts adds intensity, engaging multiple muscle groups and enhancing core stability. </p><p>This day's routine focuses on refining muscle definition and building on the strength gains from Day 1. By constantly varying the exercises, the workout prevents muscle adaptation and plateauing, ensuring continuous progress and sculpting a well-defined upper body.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-Five:-Shoulders-And-Arms-2">Day Five: Shoulders And Arms 2</h3><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Day-Six:-Legs-2">Day Six: Legs 2</h3><p>The final day of the Arnold split cycle, Day 6, brings another intense leg day focusing on front squats, Romanian deadlifts, and Bulgarian split squats. </p><p>This session aims to address any remaining weaknesses in the lower body, ensuring balanced strength and muscular development. Incorporating variations that challenge stability and coordination, like the Bulgarian split squat, enhances muscle engagement and promotes functional strength. </p><p>This workout not only builds on the foundation set by the first leg day but also introduces exercises that stimulate muscle growth from different angles, encouraging well-rounded development and preventing imbalances. The goal is to finish the week strong, laying the groundwork for both aesthetic improvements and performance enhancements.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is The Arnold Split?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/What-Is-The-Arnold-Split.jpg" alt="Arnold Split" class="wp-image-20850"/>Arnold split training improves your muscle mass. <span>Photo: fxquadro/Freepik</span></figure><p>The Arnold Schwarzenegger split is the name given to a six-day training split that was often used by Arnold himself. While this wasn’t the only training program he used, it has become his most well-known and most used by the general public.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Does Arnold’s Workout Split Look Like?</strong></h3><p>The Arnold split workout plan consists of three training sessions repeated twice for a total of six sessions in a week. Many people falsely compare this to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8372753/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">push-pull</a> leg (PPL) split which is another three-day training split. </p><p>In a PPL Arnold split, muscles are grouped by function. That is, your upper body pushing muscles are grouped together (chest, shoulders, triceps) for one training day and your upper body pulling muscles are grouped together (back, biceps) for another, while your lower body has its own day.</p><p>In comparison, Arnold grouped his muscles into sections; lower body one day, upper body the next, and a final day for shoulders and arms. This design grouped opposing muscles together, known as agonist-antagonist muscles, and worked them on the same day. For example, the triceps and biceps or quads and hamstrings.</p><p>The three days of an Arnold split look like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Day One</strong>: Chest And Back (Pectorals, all back muscles).</li><li><strong>Day Two</strong>: Shoulders And Arms (Deltoids, biceps, triceps, forearms).</li><li><strong>Day Three</strong>: Legs (Quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, calves).</li></ul><p>Days one through three would then be repeated with one day of rest after.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">Benefits Of The Arnold Split Workout</h2><p>Other than the reward of knowing that you are training just like the master himself, there are many additional benefits to this program. Here are our favorite three benefits to training the Arnold split.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Training Volume For Muscle Growth</h3><p>Arnold's training was intense, and so is this workout. This is a high-volume training program that schedules a total of six training sessions every week. “Volume” refers to the total amount of work placed on a specific muscle. This can be calculated by simply adding the total number of sets in a week by adding the total load a muscle moves (i.e. 3 X 10 with 100lbs = 3,000lbs)</p><p>Regardless of how you calculate volume, the Arnold split allows you to build a lot of it. This is crucial as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322023636_Evidence-Based_Guidelines_for_Resistance_Training_Volume_to_Maximize_Muscle_Hypertrophy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">volume is the most critical</a> factor for muscle hypertrophy. If <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/workouts/5-day-workout-split" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">building muscle</a> is your goal with resistance training, the Arnold workout split will deliver those results.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Train Each Muscle Group Twice A Week</strong></h3><p>Let's be clear. You can definitely build muscle by training a body part once a week. However, the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-016-0543-8?correlationId=4d9ea02c-da9a-44df-a279-bfae59b39531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest sports research</a> suggests that hitting a muscle twice weekly is optimal, even with the same number of sets.</p><p>For one, this works well with your body's recovery mechanisms. When you go to the gym, you'll break down your muscles and then need two to three days to fully recover. If you train the muscle once a week you would then have to wait another three to four days to train it again.</p><p>In comparison, when training a muscle twice a week, you train the muscles after its recovery. This allows the muscle to constantly be in the training & recovery cycle which maximizes its growth potential.</p><p>In addition, splitting the total number of sets into two sessions allows for a more intense workout. For example, training the chest with six exercises in one day will produce a lot of "junk reps" as you will be fatigued by your fourth exercise (assuming you train hard enough). Instead, use three exercises in both sessions (i.e., Monday and Thursday) to allow for a more effective workout.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Easily Perform Advance Techniques</strong></h3><p>As mentioned above, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s workout split is set up so that agonist and antagonist muscle groups are trained on the same day. This allows you to use an advanced training technique known as a superset.&nbsp;</p><p>A super set is when you train opposing muscles back-to-back in the same set. For example, you may perform the barbell bench press, take a short rest (15 seconds or so), and then perform some chin-ups.&nbsp;</p><p>This has some important benefits, including:</p><ul><li>Increases workload.</li><li>Decreases time.</li><li>Improve conditioning.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-start">How To Do The Arnold Split?</h2><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/How-To-Do-The-Arnold-Split.jpg" alt="Arnold Split" class="wp-image-20846"/>Arnold split helps you know how to organize your workout plan. <span>Photo: Freepik</span></figure><p>We know what the Arnold split is but now we need to know how to perform it. Remember that the Arnold split doesn’t necessarily tell you what exercises to do, but tells you how to organize your workout plan.&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, let’s examine some of the training methodologies used in Arnold’s training program.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use Variety In Your Movements</h3><p>Arnold strongly believed in including slight variations in your movements. For example, if you’re doing an incline bench press, use various angles. When doing bent-over barbell rolls in a back session, do bent-over barbell rows and dumbbell rows as well to mix it up.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choose Two To Three Exercises For Major Muscle Groups</h3><p>Choose two to three exercises for your major muscle groups. This is your chest, back, & shoulders. For your legs, choose three pushing exercises (anterior leg muscles) and three pulling exercises (posterior muscles).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choose One To Three Exercises For Smaller Muscle Groups</h3><p>For your biceps, triceps, calves, and abs, choose one to three exercises per session. This will vary depending on how much time you have and if you perform special sets.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use One To Two Exercises To Train Core</h3><p>You can train core every training session so you only need to choose one, or perhaps two exercises each session. Use different movement patterns including:</p><ul><li>Flexion in lower abs (Leg raise, hanging knee raise).</li><li>Flexion in upper abs (Reverse crunch).</li><li>Anti-rotation (Pallof press, plank).</li><li>Lateral.</li><li>Rotation.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use Max Effort&nbsp;</h3><p>If you’re going to run the Arnold split you must train intensely. By always using max effort reps, Arnold ensured he was working up to muscle failure every set. Therefore, treat every set as if it’s the only set you’re doing and make the most of it.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use Four To Five Sets And Five To 20 Reps</h3><p>One unique aspect of this training program is the use of high sets. Instead of three sets as most other workout routines use, Arnold frequently used four or five sets. This even includes smaller training such as his forearm training.</p><p>In terms of reps, Arnold used a wide range; anywhere from five to twenty. That said, the majority of his training was in the 8-12 rep range. He saved heavier sets for the primary exercise of the day while using ultra-high reps (15-20) for various leg exercises.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use Supersets In Moderation</h3><p>As we spoke about above, the Arnold split works very well utilizing supersets. However, don’t get carried away with using them.</p><p>Unless you’re short on time and need to get your workout in fast, you should only use one or two supersets at most. Further, these should be done towards the end of your workout when using smaller exercises.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Deload Every Eight To 12 Weeks&nbsp;</h3><p>One of the benefits of the Arnold split is that it allows a lot of training volume. While this is awesome for muscle growth, it will also mean that performing a deload is that much more important.</p><p>A deload is a training strategy to allow full recovery. To perform one, you will follow your same program but simply half the weight used.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, let’s say you are performing the bench press with a four to eight reps scheme and 200 lbs. During your deload, you would continue to use a four to eight reps scheme but you would use 100lbs instead.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading list-end">Conclusion</h2><p>The Arnold split is a serious workout plan for serious lifters. This is not for beginners, as it would most likely be too intense for any meaningful progress. However, if you’ve been in the gym for some time, the Arnold split could be just what you need to take your training to the next level.&nbsp;</p><p>Many programs exist for lifting weights, and while we can’t say this is the best program ever, we can say it was used by the best bodybuilder ever and is one of the most effective you can use.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1702523477226"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Is the Arnold split more effective?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The Arnold split is very effective for intermediate and advanced athletes. That said, it’s hard to say if it’s more effective than other splits as there are too many factors to consider.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1702523486457"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>What was Arnold’s six-day split?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Arnold’s six-day workout split is a six-day split that rotates through three groups of muscle.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1702523496223"><strong class="schema-faq-question"><strong>Is the Arnold split good for building muscle?</strong></strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The Arnold workout split provides a lot of volume which is the key factor in building muscle.</p> </div> </div>					]]>

					<p>The 300 film required actors with sculpted, warrior-like bodies to embody the legendary <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356438803_THE_ARMY_OF_THE_POLIS_OF_SPARTA_AND_ITS_MANIFESTATION_AS_A_MILITARY_DEMOCRACY_AND_AS_AN_INSTRUMENT_OF_HEGEMONY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spartan soldiers</a>. Hollywood trainer Mark Twight was given the challenge of transforming the cast into lean, muscular fighting machines. Gerard Butler and his co-stars underwent an intense four-month training period to achieve their impressive on-screen appearances.</p><p>Twight developed the 300 workout as a crucial part of the actors' preparation. This regimen focused on full-body compound movements that built functional strength, stamina, and performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Many fitness enthusiasts wonder, <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/how-many-sets-and-reps-should-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"How many sets and reps should I do</a> when attempting this challenge?" The original 300 workout consists of six exercises totaling 300 repetitions, performed with minimal rest.&nbsp;</p><p>Since its inception, various adaptations have emerged to cater to different fitness levels and equipment availability. However, the original version remains a testament to the grueling regimen that sculpted the cast's iconic Spartan physiques.&nbsp;</p><div class="wp-block-group ft-snippet"><p class="has-medium-font-size">Spartan 300 Workout Plan</p><p>Here is the weekly breakdown of the 300 Spartan workout:</p><ul><li>Day 1: 300 Spartan workout.</li><li>Day 2: Rest or light cardio and stretching.</li><li>Day 3: 300 Spartan workout.&nbsp;</li><li>Day 4: Rest of light cardio and stretching.</li><li>Day 5: 300 Spartan workout.</li><li>Day 6: Rest or light cardio and stretching.</li><li>Day 7: Rest or stretch only.</li></ul></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 300 Workout</h2><p>This is an intense training system and is not meant to be performed every day.

It improves cardiovascular endurance and overall heart health effectively.</p><p>Incorporating exercises that improve cardiovascular health is crucial, given the global impact of heart diseases. A staggering <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">17.9 million</a> people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, making it the leading cause of death worldwide.

This metric indicates your cardiorespiratory fitness and aerobic endurance capabilities. A higher VO2 max suggests more efficient oxygen use during physical activities.</p><p>Sustained intensity enhances oxygen utilization and boosts VO2 max. Performing workouts like the 300 Spartan workout may lead to a lower resting heart rate. Plus, blood pressure reduction becomes a natural outcome of consistent training.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enhanced Muscular Endurance</h3><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.endomondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Enhanced-Muscular-Endurance-endomondo.jpg" alt="Enhanced Muscular Endurance" class="wp-image-35578"/>The 300 workout focuses on muscular endurance with high-volume movements. <span>Photo: master1305/Freepik</span></figure><p>High repetitions with minimal rest improve <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016749432300033X#:~:text=The%20ability%20of%20a%20muscle%20or%20muscle%20group%20to%20perform%20repeated%20contractions%20against%20a%20load%20for%20an%20extended%20period%20is%20commonly%20referred%20to%20as%20LME%2C%20or%20interchangeably%20described%20as%20muscle%20endurance%20or%20muscular%20endurance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">muscular endurance</a> across major muscle groups.

It fosters psychological resilience and self-discipline beyond physical training. Mental toughness extends into various life domains.</p><p>The sense of accomplishment boosts self-confidence significantly. Motivation increases with each successful workout completion. Participants develop a warrior-like mental approach to challenges.</p><p>Workplace <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1074418/full#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20that%20physical,also%20influenced%20by%20negative%20factors." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stress and pressure</a>, relationship difficulties, and personal transitions become more manageable. The discipline of completing this workout translates directly into life skills. You learn to view challenges as opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable barriers.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips To Follow For The 300 Workout</h2><ul><li>This is an intense workout and should not be attempted by beginners. Make sure you learn proper deadlift form and build up your overall conditioning before attempting the 300 Spartan workout.</li><li>Do not rest between exercises and movements. If you can't complete the required number of reps for an exercise, you may rest for a brief period until you can continue. Consider modifications if the full routine feels overwhelming, and work your way up to a full, non-stop version.&nbsp;</li><li>If you feel faint or dizzy, take a break and drink some water to see if this makes you feel better. If you continue feeling unwell, stop the workout altogether and get a medical clearance before trying it again.</li><li>Focus on maintaining proper form during each exercise. Fatigue can compromise technique, so stay mindful throughout.&nbsp;</li><li>The 300 Spartan workout should be combined with a sensible eating plan based on goals and current body fat levels.</li><li>Hydrate consistently before, during, and after training. Studies show that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8001428/#:~:text=The%20negative%20influences,exercise%20performance%20declines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dehydration</a> can have a negative influence on exercise performance.&nbsp;</li><li>Understanding <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/training/what-is-progressive-overload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive overload</a> is crucial for continuous improvement.

This workout pushes you beyond your perceived limits, revealing your true potential.
