Allow people to filter, search, and sort your reviews.

== Description ==

Allow people to filter, search, and sort your reviews.

Simply enable the filters option in the summary shortcode or block to make the rating bars clickable, and in the reviews shortcode or block to add the filter controls above the reviews.

You can also use the new filters shortcode or block if you need additional customisation as it allows you to easily hide any of the filter controls.
