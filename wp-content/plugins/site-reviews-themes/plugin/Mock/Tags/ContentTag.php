Safe and secure for our five year old German Shorthaired Pointer to stretch his legs. He enjoys chasing the crows, his frisbee, as well as investigating the rest of the six-foot-high fenced area. Running around made him muddy on one occasion, but the provided water hose sorted that before getting back into the car. We are lucky to have this on our doorstep and use it on a regular basis.';
